Dinner Confidential's mission is to help build a world where women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.
We explore the full spectrum of the feminine experience through storytelling and community. Each month we investigate a different social topic globally (i.e.: Failure, Sexuality, Courage etc) through intimate dinners and then share the learnings with our community. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.

Our SUMMER Topics:

Thursday, July 18th ""Anger"" --> We all know the feeling. Whether political or personal, something happens that sparks a flame inside of you, you feel your blood begin to boil. It's heated, it's powerful, and it can feel all consuming. Many of us are seasoned in repressing our anger, we pretend it does not exist. Perhaps some of us live in a state of perpetual anger - it is the lens through which we view the world. Whatever it may be, our anger is real and it is valid. But how many of us feel we have a healthy relationship with this emotion? Let's have a conversation about anger - how it feels and how it shows up in our lives. 
Thursday, August 29th ""Trust"" --> When we feel trust - whether for ourselves, for a loved one, for a community - there's a sense of safety and security that allows us to to open and truly be ourselves. Trust is so fundamental to relating, and yet, can feel so hard to establish - and so easily broken. What does it mean to be worthy of trust, and how do we cultivate trusting relationships in our lives? And if that trust is broken, how do we recover, and allow ourselves to be open to trusting again? Let's have a conversation about trust - how to create it, maintain it, and rebuild it when it's gone.


Thursday, Sept 19th --> ""Power"" - Governing moments both ordinary and extraordinary - from the office, to the bedroom, to our friendships - our relationship with power often emerges from its imbalance. Sometimes we feel strong, influential, and ""better"" than others. And on the flipside, there are times when we can feel inferior, worthless or unsafe. Let's explore our relationship with our “power” — what happens when we abuse it OR it’s taken away (either by ourselves or others)? But what about our true, authentic power - the one where we don't feel inferior or superior to anyone - but rather, simply true to ourselves. What does it take - and how does it feel - to really stand there?

During our intimate dinners (7-10 max), our experienced hosts create a safe container for women to come together and talk with vulnerability and honesty about our most personal topics and emotions (e.g. self-confidence, fear, control).
After each dinner, we identify the key learnings and insights from the night and share them with our community so they, too can benefit from the experience. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.
We are currently hosting dinners in over 20 cities around the world. 
FAQs
Do attendees know each other?


Sometimes. But usually they don’t and that’s part of the magic. Coming into a place full of strangers to open up and share some of your most personal experiences is very powerful. No one there knows your history, you are a blank canvas. People won’t judge you or give you advice (unless you specifically ask for it). We are there to listen, share and connect.



Do I need to prepare for the Dinner?


A little bit! Your host will send all the details of the night via email, including a few questions for you to reflect upon prior the Dinner. All Dinners start with an intimate set of introductions, where each guest share her stories and is deeply heard.



How much are the dinners and what’s included?


Dinners are $15 and they include a healthy and yummy meal. We invite our guests to bring one thing to drink (wine, flavored water, etc.). Note that we are NOT making any profit from these evening and the fee only covers the cost.



Do the meals follow certain dietary guidelines? 


Our hosts will always ensure there are vegetarian options available. If you have specific dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate with your host at least 1.5 weeks in advance.



How do you keep confidentiality?


We include a vow of confidentiality in our invitation, and reiterate the importance of confidentiality at the start of each dinner. We create a strong container of trust and integrity, and expect the same of all of our participants.



What makes DC different from a women’s circles?


Our secret is our hosts and the stories we tell! Our dinners are led by professional moderators, researchers and facilitators all around the world. Brilliant women with years of experience conducting challenging conversations amongst diverse groups of people. We’re less about the woo-woo, and more about the raw, real and impactful conversations with tangible insights for our guests and community to take action and implement within their daily lives.



What do you mean when you say “women”?


Anyone that is female identifying. Inclusivity is one of our core values! We welcome women of all ages, colors, religions and backgrounds. If you are male identifying and would love to attend a dinner, let’s talk.



What’s your cancelation policy?


We put a lot of love and effort into these dinners so please do your best to avoid a last minute cancellation. If you need to cancel, try to find a replacement. All cancellations made less than one week in advance can’t be refunded.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
