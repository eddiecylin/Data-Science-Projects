First, you will be greeted with some lovely Italian sparkling wine to refresh and cleanse the palate. 
We will then offer a tasting of six distinctive wines, from parts of Italy that are not as talked about, but are making world class wines. We will begin by focusing on wines from the islands of Sicily and Sardegna. Moving up the boot to Campania and then on to the North where we will discuss Trentino and the Valle D'Aosta. With a range of styles as long as the country itself, we hope to show a new an exciting side of the land of 1,000 varieties of wine.
