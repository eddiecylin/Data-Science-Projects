Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.



Welcome Reception, Wednesday, December 11, 2019

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City. Gerry will share a great (old) story about the brass cannon embedded there and a nice, short tour of the campus.

Frequently Asked Questions:
Are there any restrictions about who may attend? Yes. Attendees must be talent acquisition and other human resource professionals whose primary job duties include the recruitment or retention of students and recent graduates of one-, two-, and four-year colleges and universities; employment advertising agencies who help their employer clients advertise their part-time, seasonal, internship, or entry-level employment opportunities; or students who are currently enrolled in a human resource program. In other words, third-party recruiters, career service office professionals, and vendors may not attend.
Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event? Yes, government-issued, photo ID is required by Google's security.
What are my parking options at the event? We encourage attendees to carpool or take public transportation when feasible. Attendees may park at no cost in any spot other than those marked as reserved.
Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event? No. We will have a list of attendees and name badges at the registration desk.
Can I update my registration information? Absolutely. You may even transfer your registration at no cost, even to someone from another organization. Just log into your Eventbrite account and make the changes that you desire. The new attendee still must meet the restrictions for who may attend the event.
Are tickets really that cheap? Absolutely, and thanks for that should be directed to our hosts at Ernst & Young.
Hotel recommendations? Definitely. We negotiated a HUGE discount at the very highly rated, W Hoboken at 225 River St, Hoboken, NJ 07030, which is only a block from the Ernst & Young office and very conveniently located to a PATH Train stop, other public transportation, and Newark Airport. Rooms are limited, so reserve yours as soon as possible at https://www.marriott.com/events/start.mi?id=1556556066577&key=GRP. The $299 rate is available for check-in as early as Saturday, December 7th and check-out as late as Monday, December 16th. Alternatively, many of those from out-of-town will stay at nearby Airbnb apartments, condos, and homes. Never stayed at an Airbnb? Save $40 by going to https://www.airbnb.com/c/stevenr537.
I can't get to the conference but would like to watch it. What are my options? Thanks to our friends at AllyO, the end-to-end AI for HR management solution, we will stream the conference on our YouTube channel so you can watch it live, delayed, or even after it has concluded.","America/New_York","2019-12-12T19:30:00Z","2019-12-12T19:30:00Z",640,426,"40.712775","-74.005973","United States","new york city","beer"
