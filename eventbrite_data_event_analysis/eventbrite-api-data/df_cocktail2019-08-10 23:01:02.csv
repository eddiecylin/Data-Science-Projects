About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z",828,315,"40.712775","-74.005973","United States","new york city","cocktail"

Class Inspirations:


As Don the Beachcomber famously quipped, ""What one rum can do, three can do better.” He created a style of cocktail that had never been seen - or imagined - in his ""Rhum Rhapsodies"" which combined multiple spirits to capture the best of what each had to offer, laying the foundation for layered, complex and richly flavored cocktails.

Class Description:


From Donn the Beachcomber's ""Rhum Rhapsodies"" -  cocktails that blended multiple spirits and components in a way that had never been attempted up until that point, to the way bartenders of today are incorporating newly available ingredients such as agave, yuzu, and fat washing into drinks. The realm of Tiki cocktails proves time and time again to be a hotbed of cocktail innovation, inspiring bartenders to experiment with a spectrum of flavors and applications that seldom appear on other styles of cocktail.
In the realm of presentation, Tiki cocktails have led the way in attention to detail in terms of elaborate vessels, garnishes, and the use of smoke, fire, and the like.  The adage “The feast starts with the eyes” speaks to the role 
the appearance of a cocktail plays in creating anticipation and impact in a cocktail.  In this class we will cover specialty ice for Tiki, garnish cuts, and more.


The class will conclude with an optional exam for those wishing to obtain the NYCE Rum Level 1 Certification, which grants access to the next level of Rum Tasting and trainings on 4 sub categories:
Raw Cane - Agiardiente, Cachcaca, and Agricole
English and Navy Style Rums
Spanish Style Rums
Rum Connoisseurship -  Extra Aged, Single Still, Rare and Limited Rums
