When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?

Sample the world of rye with rye whiskey, farm beers, breads, and kosher barbecue at Food Karma’s featured event of NY Rye Week! 
In 2014 Food Karma’s Brewer’s Choice event jumpstarted interest among brewers working with regional malts. Five years later the number of regional malt facilities has grown. More farmers are growing specialty grains, select bakers are using regional flour, and more breweries - from North Carolina to New York to Maine - are making beer with malt and grain that is local to them. This all-inclusive event will dive into the intersection between rye used in whiskey, beer, and bread! 
Food Karma’s Founder, Jimmy Carbone will also be celebrating 500 episodes as the host of Beer Sessions Radio on Heritage Radio Network. Join him to celebrate on October 16, 2019!

All inclusive Food and Drink Tasting Featuring: 
Rye Whiskeys

Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City. Gerry will share a great (old) story about the brass cannon embedded there and a nice, short tour of the campus.
