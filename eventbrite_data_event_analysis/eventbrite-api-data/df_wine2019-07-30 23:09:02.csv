Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
