 During this intimate workshop hosted by Ana Lygia, you will taste wines and learn to make a calming oxymel. This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.
