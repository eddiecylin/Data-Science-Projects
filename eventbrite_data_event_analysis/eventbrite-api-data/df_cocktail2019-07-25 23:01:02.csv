About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z",828,315,"40.712775","-74.005973","United States","new york city","cocktail"

Albert’s love of Mixology, and his deep knowledge of the history and technique of crafting the perfect libation makes for an unforgettable Saturday afternoon.
