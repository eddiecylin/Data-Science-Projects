This event is not only rich in beer and good company; it’s also rich in downtown history. Local historian, Belinda Crowson, will lead the history portion of the tour. Belinda is well known for her witty and interesting storytelling as well as her passion for anything history related.
Joining Belinda will be beer aficionado, Stephen Deppisch, and George Kuhl. They will treat your taste buds to diverse craft beers at each stop along the tour route.
The tour is scheduled for five-hours, 2 p.m. through 7 p.m. The walking tour will stop at five of our unique downtown business and cultural venues. Each stop will feature a different craft beer to be tasted and perhaps a small bite to eat.
Along the trek to-and-from, the beer tasting stops, Belinda will provide attendees with stories such as the history of prostitution in Lethbridge as well as other hidden, history gems that are all part of the history of our downtown core.
Besides our fantastic tour guides, you’ll have your very own passport to be able to record the beers you like and where you purchased them from. You’ll also receive a souvenir beer glass to remember the day by.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.

FAQs
What does ""dinner and drinks included"" mean?
Food includes appetizers, dinner and a variety of desserts. Our grillmaster will be serving BBQ fare alongside other dishes. Vegetarian and vegan options will be available for all courses. We'll have lots of food for everyone so come hungry!
Drinks include all alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks at the bar, including beer, wine, our always-popular homemade sangria, summer mojitos and more!

Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event?
No, but any guest consuming alcoholic beverages must be 21 or over, and upon request, show proof of age at the bar.

What are my transportation/parking options for getting to and from the event?
The fun takes place in the heart of midtown Manhattan, so naturally there are lots of convenient ways to get here! Walking is not only great exercise, but a quick way to come if you're already in the Hell's Kitchen/Columbus Circle neighborhood. For all others we recommend mass transit, as we're conveniently located one block away from Columbus Circle, serviced by the A B C D & 1 trains. And we're steps away from bus stops serviced by the M11, M57 & M31.
For those traveling by car, onstreet metered parking, as well as two parking garages, are located on our block.

How can I contact the organizer with any questions?
Email questions to info@togetheronenewyork.org or call us at 646-580-3309.

Do I have to bring my printed ticket to the event?
No, just show your voucher on any mobile device.

Is my ticket transferrable?
Yes, you can purchase a ticket for another person.

Is it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn't match the person who attends?
Yes. And if you're purchasing more than one ticket under a single name, it's not necessary for all guests in your group to arrive at once. Just let the lobby attendant know the names of anyone in your group who will be arriving separately.","America/New_York","2019-08-03T03:00:00Z","2019-08-03T03:00:00Z",640,466,"40.712775","-74.005973","United States","new york city","beer"

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

More about Mission North:
This summer, the team at Mission North was thrilled to send five talented young athletes from the Bronx to the running camp at Camp Chipinaw in upstate New York. Our sponsored athletes enjoyed one-on-one coaching, group runs, healthy meals to fuel them, and new friends to help them along. We at Mission North have the privilege of giving young people these opportunities thanks to generous support and donations from athletes and adventure-seekers like all of you: people who understand how much personal growth can come from playing sports. 
 
While we look forward to continuing this work, we also strongly believe that it's high time New York City provide young people of color in the Bronx with the in-school sports opportunities they deserve. We are excited to be founding members of the Fair Play project, an advocacy group committed to ending resource segregation in the public schools. You can learn more about our efforts to demand equal access to school sports here:

About Artists:
RAFA BARRIOS
Young DJ and producer Rafa Barrios is on fire all over the world. The Sevilla native has published several records on various labels including but not limited to Intec, Stereo, Sola, and Blackflag. Rafa is one of the most prolific producers on the market in 2019; his Tech House music bringing a new and refined sound to the House music community. His tracks have been played by Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, Jamie Jones, Danny Tenaglia, Dubfire, and Stacey Pullen -who are not only some of the most respected artists in the industry but inspirations in Barrios’ musical upbringing.
Rafa has recently remixed artists Kim English, Chus & Ceballos, Boris, Gabriel Ananda, and Danny Tenaglia. All of which led to his production of hits’ Flip Flop and Woohoo- both on Sola, that were in Beatport’s Top 10 in 2018.
The past few years he has been performing in Barcelona, Madrid, Amsterdam, Bali, Belgium, Montreal, Miami Florida, Brooklyn New York, Ecuador, and Peru- just to name a few. Currently, you can catch him performing under elite labels Elrow and Repopulate Mars. Rafa’s Spanish roots shine through the deep current that is his unique version of tech house, with a career projection that has no limit.

OSCAR L
With more than 10 years of international experience behind him, Oscar L is one of the essential names of the Iberian electronic scene. Personality, perseverance and energy define him and are qualities that are also found in his particular sound, a combination of influences and peculiarities that have caught the attention of the best labels on the globe, such as Suara, Toolroom, Truesoul, 1605, Stereo or Material, amongst others, all of them being connoisseurs of the talent and the effectiveness that the productions of the Spanish artist reunite.
A tasteful mixture that have been used to put a good handful of tracks at the top of the Techno and House charts. These capabilities have given Oscar the opportunity to travel the world making the most diverse audiences dance. Dozens of cities from different continents throughout the world have enjoyed the intensity and warmth that his sets transmit to the dance floor. But the diffusion of his music does not end there, for a few years now, Oscar has also been directing his own radio show, D-Mix, which is broadcasted in 16 countries through 90 different stations. Oscar L's professional framework continues to expand, foreshadowing a prolific future and a privileged position amongst the most outstanding figures of his country.

For some employers, diversity and making their workforces more inclusive was just something that they felt was the moral thing to do. For other employers, it was legally compelled. Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.



Welcome Reception, Wednesday, December 11, 2019

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City.

In other words, third-party recruiters, career service office professionals, and vendors may not attend.
Are there ID or minimum age requirements to enter the event? Yes, government-issued, photo ID is required by Google's security.
What are my parking options at the event? We encourage attendees to carpool or take public transportation when feasible. Attendees may park at no cost in any spot other than those marked as reserved.

Can I update my registration information? Absolutely. You may even transfer your registration at no cost, even to someone from another organization. Just log into your Eventbrite account and make the changes that you desire. The new attendee still must meet the restrictions for who may attend the event.
