All of these wines are very special, but are not in the ""mainstream"" of wine consumption. They are for those who are in the know, or for those who have a trustworthy wine shop who are, in the know. Besides being exceptional wines, the prices of lesser known wines tend to be lower than more popular varietals of the same quality.
First, you will be greeted with some lovely Italian sparkling wine to refresh and cleanse the palate. 
We will then offer a tasting of six distinctive wines, from parts of Italy that are not as talked about, but are making world class wines. We will begin by focusing on wines from the islands of Sicily and Sardegna. Moving up the boot to Campania and then on to the North where we will discuss Trentino and the Valle D'Aosta. With a range of styles as long as the country itself, we hope to show a new an exciting side of the land of 1,000 varieties of wine.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.
