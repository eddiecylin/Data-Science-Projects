KEVIN BROOKS
Kevin Brooks left the legal services industry to follow his love of beer a little more than five years ago, hoping to find his way as a beer professional. A start at Murray's Cheese gave him an unexpected love of cheese and put him in a prime position to help with the launch of the beer program there. After two great years he left to work the streets as a rep for a beer distributor, selling beer to some of the top craft beer bars in New York City. A desire for a change found him back at his retail roots, managing the store at Top Hops and continuing his adventures in beer.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.

KEVIN BROOKS
Kevin Brooks left the legal services industry to follow his love of beer a little more than five years ago, hoping to find his way as a beer professional. A start at Murray's Cheese gave him an unexpected love of cheese and put him in a prime position to help with the launch of the beer program there. After two great years he left to work the streets as a rep for a beer distributor, selling beer to some of the top craft beer bars in New York City. A desire for a change found him back at his retail roots, managing the store at Top Hops and continuing his adventures in beer.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.

For some employers, diversity and making their workforces more inclusive was just something that they felt was the moral thing to do. For other employers, it was legally compelled. Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City.

KEVIN BROOKS
Kevin Brooks left the legal services industry to follow his love of beer a little more than five years ago, hoping to find his way as a beer professional. A start at Murray's Cheese gave him an unexpected love of cheese and put him in a prime position to help with the launch of the beer program there. After two great years he left to work the streets as a rep for a beer distributor, selling beer to some of the top craft beer bars in New York City. A desire for a change found him back at his retail roots, managing the store at Top Hops and continuing his adventures in beer.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.
Tickets are non-refundable and subject to applicable taxes and fees, as well as changes. All sales are final, no exceptions!

Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City. Gerry will share a great (old) story about the brass cannon embedded there and a nice, short tour of the campus.

KEVIN BROOKS
Kevin Brooks left the legal services industry to follow his love of beer a little more than five years ago, hoping to find his way as a beer professional. A start at Murray's Cheese gave him an unexpected love of cheese and put him in a prime position to help with the launch of the beer program there. After two great years he left to work the streets as a rep for a beer distributor, selling beer to some of the top craft beer bars in New York City. A desire for a change found him back at his retail roots, managing the store at Top Hops and continuing his adventures in beer.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.

For some employers, diversity and making their workforces more inclusive was just something that they felt was the moral thing to do. For other employers, it was legally compelled. Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.



Welcome Reception, Wednesday, December 11, 2019

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City.

KEVIN BROOKS
Kevin Brooks left the legal services industry to follow his love of beer a little more than five years ago, hoping to find his way as a beer professional. A start at Murray's Cheese gave him an unexpected love of cheese and put him in a prime position to help with the launch of the beer program there. After two great years he left to work the streets as a rep for a beer distributor, selling beer to some of the top craft beer bars in New York City. A desire for a change found him back at his retail roots, managing the store at Top Hops and continuing his adventures in beer.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor.

Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning.

Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.

With ready access to quality water from the Ridgewood Reservoir, plentiful hops grown in upstate New York, and a thriving German immigrant population, it's no wonder why Bushwick was such a brewing powerhouse. So it's fitting that we'll end at one of the area's newest breweries, Interboro, to toast the triumphant return of brewing to Brooklyn!

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.

Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City.

A few hours before showtime, me and some friends rolled a bunch of tires down the street for a makeshift stage. And it worked. For three years. Now we're moving down the block. There have been over eighty(!) shows, and I’m psyched about every lineup I put together.
NO COVER. Cash bar with $3 beers. Taco and quesadilla specials too if you're into that

If you thought that last paragraph was self-serving, here is a shameless list of Usama’s achievements. He most recently traveled to Montreal as one of the New Faces at Just For Laughs in 2018. Shortly after he was passed at the world famous Comedy Cellar in New York. He made his standup television debut on BET's 50 Central.

P.S. Usama can probably beatbox better than you can.

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.

Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

A few hours before showtime, me and some friends rolled a bunch of tires down the street for a makeshift stage. And it worked. For three years. Now we're moving down the block. There have been over eighty(!) shows, and I’m psyched about every lineup I put together.
NO COVER. Cash bar with $3 beers. Taco and quesadilla specials too if you're into that

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York",2019-09-18 00:00:00,2019-09-18 00:00:00,828,315,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city",NA

About the Artist:
Quickly becoming the hottest thing out of New Zealand since Russell Crowe, QUIX had a massive year in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing down. 2016 has been absolutely killer from him, gaining the support from all top tier trap & bass DJs in the scene. Boasting a unique trap sound full of 808’s and wonky samples & sound design, QUIX has a style that can’t be matched, although many have tried.Not only are QUIX’s original tracks game-changing, he has also proven his artistic versatility with collaborations with artists like Gladiator, Party Thieves, KRNE, ATLiens, Dabow, Instant Party, and Woolymammoth, not to mention the collaborations in progress with main stage superstars like UZ, Boombox Cartel, Slumberjack, Branchez, & Peking Duk.Although he has been consistently destroying clubs & venues around Australia & New Zealand while sharing the stages of some of the best international trap/bass acts, he will soon enter the worldwide stage of coming to tour North America extensively.  With a whole stack of unreleased music up his sleeve, trust that QUIX will continue his steady explosion and won’t slow down his takeover for anything.Releases on Ultra Music, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, Buygore, Dim Mak, & Main Course.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York",2019-09-18 00:00:00,2019-09-18 00:00:00,828,315,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city",NA

About the Artist:
Quickly becoming the hottest thing out of New Zealand since Russell Crowe, QUIX had a massive year in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing down. 2016 has been absolutely killer from him, gaining the support from all top tier trap & bass DJs in the scene. Boasting a unique trap sound full of 808’s and wonky samples & sound design, QUIX has a style that can’t be matched, although many have tried.Not only are QUIX’s original tracks game-changing, he has also proven his artistic versatility with collaborations with artists like Gladiator, Party Thieves, KRNE, ATLiens, Dabow, Instant Party, and Woolymammoth, not to mention the collaborations in progress with main stage superstars like UZ, Boombox Cartel, Slumberjack, Branchez, & Peking Duk.Although he has been consistently destroying clubs & venues around Australia & New Zealand while sharing the stages of some of the best international trap/bass acts, he will soon enter the worldwide stage of coming to tour North America extensively.  With a whole stack of unreleased music up his sleeve, trust that QUIX will continue his steady explosion and won’t slow down his takeover for anything.Releases on Ultra Music, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, Buygore, Dim Mak, & Main Course.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Young DJ and producer Rafa Barrios is on fire all over the world. The Sevilla native has published several records on various labels including but not limited to Intec, Stereo, Sola, and Blackflag. Rafa is one of the most prolific producers on the market in 2019; his Tech House music bringing a new and refined sound to the House music community. His tracks have been played by Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, Jamie Jones, Danny Tenaglia, Dubfire, and Stacey Pullen -who are not only some of the most respected artists in the industry but inspirations in Barrios’ musical upbringing.
Rafa has recently remixed artists Kim English, Chus & Ceballos, Boris, Gabriel Ananda, and Danny Tenaglia. All of which led to his production of hits’ Flip Flop and Woohoo- both on Sola, that were in Beatport’s Top 10 in 2018.
The past few years he has been performing in Barcelona, Madrid, Amsterdam, Bali, Belgium, Montreal, Miami Florida, Brooklyn New York, Ecuador, and Peru- just to name a few. Currently, you can catch him performing under elite labels Elrow and Repopulate Mars. Rafa’s Spanish roots shine through the deep current that is his unique version of tech house, with a career projection that has no limit.

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York",2019-09-18 00:00:00,2019-09-18 00:00:00,828,315,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city",NA

Quickly becoming the hottest thing out of New Zealand since Russell Crowe, QUIX had a massive year in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing down. 2016 has been absolutely killer from him, gaining the support from all top tier trap & bass DJs in the scene. Boasting a unique trap sound full of 808’s and wonky samples & sound design, QUIX has a style that can’t be matched, although many have tried.Not only are QUIX’s original tracks game-changing, he has also proven his artistic versatility with collaborations with artists like Gladiator, Party Thieves, KRNE, ATLiens, Dabow, Instant Party, and Woolymammoth, not to mention the collaborations in progress with main stage superstars like UZ, Boombox Cartel, Slumberjack, Branchez, & Peking Duk.Although he has been consistently destroying clubs & venues around Australia & New Zealand while sharing the stages of some of the best international trap/bass acts, he will soon enter the worldwide stage of coming to tour North America extensively.  With a whole stack of unreleased music up his sleeve, trust that QUIX will continue his steady explosion and won’t slow down his takeover for anything.Releases on Ultra Music, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, Buygore, Dim Mak, & Main Course.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York",2019-09-18 00:00:00,2019-09-18 00:00:00,828,315,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city","cocktail"

About the Artist:
Quickly becoming the hottest thing out of New Zealand since Russell Crowe, QUIX had a massive year in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing down. 2016 has been absolutely killer from him, gaining the support from all top tier trap & bass DJs in the scene. Boasting a unique trap sound full of 808’s and wonky samples & sound design, QUIX has a style that can’t be matched, although many have tried.Not only are QUIX’s original tracks game-changing, he has also proven his artistic versatility with collaborations with artists like Gladiator, Party Thieves, KRNE, ATLiens, Dabow, Instant Party, and Woolymammoth, not to mention the collaborations in progress with main stage superstars like UZ, Boombox Cartel, Slumberjack, Branchez, & Peking Duk.Although he has been consistently destroying clubs & venues around Australia & New Zealand while sharing the stages of some of the best international trap/bass acts, he will soon enter the worldwide stage of coming to tour North America extensively.  With a whole stack of unreleased music up his sleeve, trust that QUIX will continue his steady explosion and won’t slow down his takeover for anything.Releases on Ultra Music, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, Buygore, Dim Mak, & Main Course.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York",2019-09-18 00:00:00,2019-09-18 00:00:00,828,315,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city","cocktail"

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate.

Produced by Austell Place and Heart for Art
This event is 21+
Please join us on August 8th at 6:30PM at Austell Place for an evening discussing Mental Health in Fashion. We are still riding the excitement from our last panel that focused on the impact of social media. This month's panel will be focusing on advertising and media and how it has an impact on the people involved in the fashion industry. Dr. Jeffrey Borenstein, Preseident & CEO of the Brain & Beahvior Research Foundation will be moderating the discussion. Panelists include creative director Holly Stevenson, artist and writer Jo Rosenthal, Glossy's Editor in Chief Jill Manoff, and Collina Strada founder Hillary Taymour. 
Claire will be producing a shoot of panelists, models and others involved in the Mental Health and fashion scene and her work will be on display for the evening. Complimentary refreshments and cocktails will be kindly provided by our sponsors SOUND drink, and BTL SVC.



PANEL MEMBERS:
Dr. Jeffrey Borenstein: Jeffrey Borenstein, M.D., serves as the President & CEO of the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation, the largest private funder of mental health research grants. Dr. Borenstein developed the Emmy Award-nominated public television program “Healthy Minds,” and serves as host of the series. The program, which is broadcast nationwide, focuses on topics in psychiatry in order to educate the public, reduce stigma and offer a message of hope. Dr. Borenstein also serves as Editor-in-Chief of Psychiatric News, the newspaper of the American Psychiatric Association and as an Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.
Dr. Borenstein is a Fellow of the New York Academy of Medicine and serves as the Chair of the Section of Psychiatry at the Academy. He has served as the President of the National Association of Psychiatric Health Systems. Among the many honors to his credit are the National Alliance on Mental Illness of NY State Connie Lieber Award, the American Psychiatric Association Special Presidential Commendation, and the Federation of Organizations Community Mental Health Man of the Year Award.
Dr. Borenstein earned his undergraduate degree at Harvard and his medical degree at New York University.

Holly Stevenson: Holly Stevenson is a creative director specialized in media, marketing, and brand development. She has consistently contributed to watershed moments for clients including J.Crew, Gap, Loft, Lou and Grey, Refinery29 and Teen Vogue. Over the course of her career, Holly has created integrated, cross-channel content with effective digital and print design, iconic video and photography, north-star communications strategies, and award-winning campaigns.
Holly specializes in transparent and inclusive marketing strategies, socially conscious creative practices, leveraging new technologies and sustainable design systems. An expert synthesizer of the cultural landscape, she crafts authentic and aesthetically sophisticated brand communications that meaningfully connect with audiences.
Holly has served on the faculty of Parson’s School of Design and her work has been exhibited internationally. She lives in New York City.

Jo Rosenthal: What does it mean to be intimate? What does it mean to be in love? What does it mean to capture somebody? What does it mean to be enraptured? What Jo finds herself frequently investigating in her art practice, are themes pertaining to the questions above.
The conceptual artists of the 90s, such as Tracey Emin and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, physically broke apart traditions in portraiture. Jo uses it as a springboard to create portraits that do not conform to the figure to show who or what they depict.
Jo's work often questions just how personal she can get with an audience by opening herself up as much as possible. Through oil paint, performance, book-making, and installation, she communicates her own journey.
Jo wants her audience to understand that it is okay to be emotional and intimate—to want to laugh and cry and want more from their overall experience—and in the process, to figure out what being themselves means in the world. Jo lives and works in Greenpoint, New York City. Only about 0.85 of her is composed of potassium, sulfur, sodium, chlorine, and magnesium. 

Hillary Taymour: Hillary Taymour (b. 1987, Palos Verdes) is the founder and designer of the fashion brand Collina Strada. She is best understood through the characteristics of her dog, Powwow, a beguiling blue merle Pomeranian with an exceptional aptitude for self presentation and interpersonal relationships but who cannot be left alone and will make a well-deserved mess if mistreated or misunderstood. She currently resides in Brooklyn and is definitely a Leo.

Jill Manoff: Jill Manoff is the editor-in-chief of Glossy, which explores the transformation of the fashion, luxury, beauty and retail industries through the lens of digital and technology. She oversees the editorial content and growth strategy of the media brand, launched in May 2016. 
Manoff joined Glossy from Mode Media, where she was the editor of Glam.com starting in July 2015. Prior to that, she was the editor of searsStyle and head copywriter in Sears’ apparel division. She spent the start of her career in St. Louis as the fashion editor of Alive magazine, the fashion director and co-founder of Saint Louis Fashion Week, and a freelance fashion stylist, working for brands including Anheuser-Busch and Caleres. ","America/New_York",2019-08-09 01:30:00,2019-08-09 01:30:00,820,312,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city","cocktail"

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York",2019-09-18 00:00:00,2019-09-18 00:00:00,828,315,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city","cocktail"

CHARLES SPRINGFIELD is a certified sommelier, wine educator and book author in New York City. He specializes in matching the right wines with the right people and the right occasions: teaching wine classes, hosting wine events and promoting overall wine appreciation.
Prior to falling headfirst into the wine business, Charles worked as a journalist and in public relations. Now he is using his unique approach to marketing communications, “life styling” experience and his love of wine to provide guidance on appreciating, understanding and enjoying wine in ways people never imaged possible.
Most recently, Charles has worked with a wide range of brands and companies including New York Vintners, Veuve Clicquot, The House of Burgundy, Wine.com, Adega Wines and Spirits, The Wine Riot and Corkbuzz Wine Studio. In 2017, he was featured as one of the Top 40 Black/African American Sommeliers in the country by LinkedIn.

 During this intimate workshop hosted by Ana Lygia, you will taste wines and learn to make a calming oxymel. This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.

About the Artist:
Quickly becoming the hottest thing out of New Zealand since Russell Crowe, QUIX had a massive year in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing down. 2016 has been absolutely killer from him, gaining the support from all top tier trap & bass DJs in the scene. Boasting a unique trap sound full of 808’s and wonky samples & sound design, QUIX has a style that can’t be matched, although many have tried.Not only are QUIX’s original tracks game-changing, he has also proven his artistic versatility with collaborations with artists like Gladiator, Party Thieves, KRNE, ATLiens, Dabow, Instant Party, and Woolymammoth, not to mention the collaborations in progress with main stage superstars like UZ, Boombox Cartel, Slumberjack, Branchez, & Peking Duk.Although he has been consistently destroying clubs & venues around Australia & New Zealand while sharing the stages of some of the best international trap/bass acts, he will soon enter the worldwide stage of coming to tour North America extensively.  With a whole stack of unreleased music up his sleeve, trust that QUIX will continue his steady explosion and won’t slow down his takeover for anything.Releases on Ultra Music, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, Buygore, Dim Mak, & Main Course.

For some employers, diversity and making their workforces more inclusive was just something that they felt was the moral thing to do. For other employers, it was legally compelled. Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City.

Dinner Confidential's mission is to help build a world where women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.
We explore the full spectrum of the feminine experience through storytelling and community. Each month we investigate a different social topic globally (i.e.: Failure, Sexuality, Courage etc) through intimate dinners and then share the learnings with our community. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.

Our SUMMER Topics:

Thursday, July 18th ""Anger"" --> We all know the feeling. Whether political or personal, something happens that sparks a flame inside of you, you feel your blood begin to boil. It's heated, it's powerful, and it can feel all consuming. Many of us are seasoned in repressing our anger, we pretend it does not exist. Perhaps some of us live in a state of perpetual anger - it is the lens through which we view the world. Whatever it may be, our anger is real and it is valid. But how many of us feel we have a healthy relationship with this emotion? Let's have a conversation about anger - how it feels and how it shows up in our lives. 
Thursday, August 29th ""Trust"" --> When we feel trust - whether for ourselves, for a loved one, for a community - there's a sense of safety and security that allows us to to open and truly be ourselves. Trust is so fundamental to relating, and yet, can feel so hard to establish - and so easily broken. What does it mean to be worthy of trust, and how do we cultivate trusting relationships in our lives? And if that trust is broken, how do we recover, and allow ourselves to be open to trusting again? Let's have a conversation about trust - how to create it, maintain it, and rebuild it when it's gone.


Thursday, Sept 19th --> ""Power"" - Governing moments both ordinary and extraordinary - from the office, to the bedroom, to our friendships - our relationship with power often emerges from its imbalance. Sometimes we feel strong, influential, and ""better"" than others. And on the flipside, there are times when we can feel inferior, worthless or unsafe. Let's explore our relationship with our “power” — what happens when we abuse it OR it’s taken away (either by ourselves or others)? But what about our true, authentic power - the one where we don't feel inferior or superior to anyone - but rather, simply true to ourselves. What does it take - and how does it feel - to really stand there? 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
During our intimate dinners (7-10 max), our experienced hosts create a safe container for women to come together and talk with vulnerability and honesty about our most personal topics and emotions (e.g. self-confidence, fear, control).
After each dinner, we identify the key learnings and insights from the night and share them with our community so they, too can benefit from the experience. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.
We are currently hosting dinners in over 20 cities around the world. 
FAQs
Do attendees know each other?


Sometimes. But usually they don’t and that’s part of the magic. Coming into a place full of strangers to open up and share some of your most personal experiences is very powerful. No one there knows your history, you are a blank canvas. People won’t judge you or give you advice (unless you specifically ask for it). We are there to listen, share and connect.



Do I need to prepare for the Dinner?


A little bit! Your host will send all the details of the night via email, including a few questions for you to reflect upon prior the Dinner. All Dinners start with an intimate set of introductions, where each guest share her stories and is deeply heard.



How much are the dinners and what’s included?


Dinners are $15 and they include a healthy and yummy meal. We invite our guests to bring one thing to drink (wine, flavored water, etc.). Note that we are NOT making any profit from these evening and the fee only covers the cost.



Do the meals follow certain dietary guidelines? 


Our hosts will always ensure there are vegetarian options available. If you have specific dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate with your host at least 1.5 weeks in advance.



How do you keep confidentiality?


We include a vow of confidentiality in our invitation, and reiterate the importance of confidentiality at the start of each dinner. We create a strong container of trust and integrity, and expect the same of all of our participants.



What makes DC different from a women’s circles?


Our secret is our hosts and the stories we tell! Our dinners are led by professional moderators, researchers and facilitators all around the world. Brilliant women with years of experience conducting challenging conversations amongst diverse groups of people. We’re less about the woo-woo, and more about the raw, real and impactful conversations with tangible insights for our guests and community to take action and implement within their daily lives.



What do you mean when you say “women”?


Anyone that is female identifying. Inclusivity is one of our core values! We welcome women of all ages, colors, religions and backgrounds. If you are male identifying and would love to attend a dinner, let’s talk.



What’s your cancelation policy?


We put a lot of love and effort into these dinners so please do your best to avoid a last minute cancellation. If you need to cancel, try to find a replacement. All cancellations made less than one week in advance can’t be refunded.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
Enjoy the rest of the summer, and see you all on Sunday, August 25th!

This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention.

About the Artist:
Quickly becoming the hottest thing out of New Zealand since Russell Crowe, QUIX had a massive year in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing down. 2016 has been absolutely killer from him, gaining the support from all top tier trap & bass DJs in the scene. Boasting a unique trap sound full of 808’s and wonky samples & sound design, QUIX has a style that can’t be matched, although many have tried.Not only are QUIX’s original tracks game-changing, he has also proven his artistic versatility with collaborations with artists like Gladiator, Party Thieves, KRNE, ATLiens, Dabow, Instant Party, and Woolymammoth, not to mention the collaborations in progress with main stage superstars like UZ, Boombox Cartel, Slumberjack, Branchez, & Peking Duk.Although he has been consistently destroying clubs & venues around Australia & New Zealand while sharing the stages of some of the best international trap/bass acts, he will soon enter the worldwide stage of coming to tour North America extensively.  With a whole stack of unreleased music up his sleeve, trust that QUIX will continue his steady explosion and won’t slow down his takeover for anything.Releases on Ultra Music, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, Buygore, Dim Mak, & Main Course.

For some employers, diversity and making their workforces more inclusive was just something that they felt was the moral thing to do. For other employers, it was legally compelled. Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

8:00pm - ?? If the weather is nice, we'll join panelist Gerry Crispin for a guided walk four blocks from the W Hoboken Hotel to Castle Point on the campus of Stevens' Institute of Technology where you'll see where Henry Hudson moored his ship when he discovered...wait for it....the Hudson River,  and the best view of New York City. Gerry will share a great (old) story about the brass cannon embedded there and a nice, short tour of the campus.

Dinner Confidential's mission is to help build a world where women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.
We explore the full spectrum of the feminine experience through storytelling and community. Each month we investigate a different social topic globally (i.e.: Failure, Sexuality, Courage etc) through intimate dinners and then share the learnings with our community. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.

Our SUMMER Topics:

Thursday, July 18th ""Anger"" --> We all know the feeling. Whether political or personal, something happens that sparks a flame inside of you, you feel your blood begin to boil. It's heated, it's powerful, and it can feel all consuming. Many of us are seasoned in repressing our anger, we pretend it does not exist. Perhaps some of us live in a state of perpetual anger - it is the lens through which we view the world. Whatever it may be, our anger is real and it is valid. But how many of us feel we have a healthy relationship with this emotion? Let's have a conversation about anger - how it feels and how it shows up in our lives. 
Thursday, August 29th ""Trust"" --> When we feel trust - whether for ourselves, for a loved one, for a community - there's a sense of safety and security that allows us to to open and truly be ourselves. Trust is so fundamental to relating, and yet, can feel so hard to establish - and so easily broken. What does it mean to be worthy of trust, and how do we cultivate trusting relationships in our lives? And if that trust is broken, how do we recover, and allow ourselves to be open to trusting again? Let's have a conversation about trust - how to create it, maintain it, and rebuild it when it's gone.


Thursday, Sept 19th --> ""Power"" - Governing moments both ordinary and extraordinary - from the office, to the bedroom, to our friendships - our relationship with power often emerges from its imbalance. Sometimes we feel strong, influential, and ""better"" than others. And on the flipside, there are times when we can feel inferior, worthless or unsafe. Let's explore our relationship with our “power” — what happens when we abuse it OR it’s taken away (either by ourselves or others)? But what about our true, authentic power - the one where we don't feel inferior or superior to anyone - but rather, simply true to ourselves. What does it take - and how does it feel - to really stand there? 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
During our intimate dinners (7-10 max), our experienced hosts create a safe container for women to come together and talk with vulnerability and honesty about our most personal topics and emotions (e.g. self-confidence, fear, control).
After each dinner, we identify the key learnings and insights from the night and share them with our community so they, too can benefit from the experience. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.
We are currently hosting dinners in over 20 cities around the world. 
FAQs
Do attendees know each other?


Sometimes. But usually they don’t and that’s part of the magic. Coming into a place full of strangers to open up and share some of your most personal experiences is very powerful. No one there knows your history, you are a blank canvas. People won’t judge you or give you advice (unless you specifically ask for it). We are there to listen, share and connect.



Do I need to prepare for the Dinner?


A little bit! Your host will send all the details of the night via email, including a few questions for you to reflect upon prior the Dinner. All Dinners start with an intimate set of introductions, where each guest share her stories and is deeply heard.



How much are the dinners and what’s included?


Dinners are $15 and they include a healthy and yummy meal. We invite our guests to bring one thing to drink (wine, flavored water, etc.). Note that we are NOT making any profit from these evening and the fee only covers the cost.



Do the meals follow certain dietary guidelines? 


Our hosts will always ensure there are vegetarian options available. If you have specific dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate with your host at least 1.5 weeks in advance.



How do you keep confidentiality?


We include a vow of confidentiality in our invitation, and reiterate the importance of confidentiality at the start of each dinner. We create a strong container of trust and integrity, and expect the same of all of our participants.



What makes DC different from a women’s circles?


Our secret is our hosts and the stories we tell! Our dinners are led by professional moderators, researchers and facilitators all around the world. Brilliant women with years of experience conducting challenging conversations amongst diverse groups of people. We’re less about the woo-woo, and more about the raw, real and impactful conversations with tangible insights for our guests and community to take action and implement within their daily lives.



What do you mean when you say “women”?


Anyone that is female identifying. Inclusivity is one of our core values! We welcome women of all ages, colors, religions and backgrounds. If you are male identifying and would love to attend a dinner, let’s talk.



What’s your cancelation policy?


We put a lot of love and effort into these dinners so please do your best to avoid a last minute cancellation. If you need to cancel, try to find a replacement. All cancellations made less than one week in advance can’t be refunded.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
Enjoy the rest of the summer, and see you all on Sunday, August 25th!

This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.

About the Artist:
Quickly becoming the hottest thing out of New Zealand since Russell Crowe, QUIX had a massive year in 2015 and showed no signs of slowing down. 2016 has been absolutely killer from him, gaining the support from all top tier trap & bass DJs in the scene. Boasting a unique trap sound full of 808’s and wonky samples & sound design, QUIX has a style that can’t be matched, although many have tried.Not only are QUIX’s original tracks game-changing, he has also proven his artistic versatility with collaborations with artists like Gladiator, Party Thieves, KRNE, ATLiens, Dabow, Instant Party, and Woolymammoth, not to mention the collaborations in progress with main stage superstars like UZ, Boombox Cartel, Slumberjack, Branchez, & Peking Duk.Although he has been consistently destroying clubs & venues around Australia & New Zealand while sharing the stages of some of the best international trap/bass acts, he will soon enter the worldwide stage of coming to tour North America extensively.  With a whole stack of unreleased music up his sleeve, trust that QUIX will continue his steady explosion and won’t slow down his takeover for anything.Releases on Ultra Music, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, Buygore, Dim Mak, & Main Course.

Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning.

Dinner Confidential's mission is to help build a world where women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.
We explore the full spectrum of the feminine experience through storytelling and community. Each month we investigate a different social topic globally (i.e.: Failure, Sexuality, Courage etc) through intimate dinners and then share the learnings with our community. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.

Our SUMMER Topics:

Thursday, July 18th ""Anger"" --> We all know the feeling. Whether political or personal, something happens that sparks a flame inside of you, you feel your blood begin to boil. It's heated, it's powerful, and it can feel all consuming. Many of us are seasoned in repressing our anger, we pretend it does not exist. Perhaps some of us live in a state of perpetual anger - it is the lens through which we view the world. Whatever it may be, our anger is real and it is valid. But how many of us feel we have a healthy relationship with this emotion? Let's have a conversation about anger - how it feels and how it shows up in our lives. 
Thursday, August 29th ""Trust"" --> When we feel trust - whether for ourselves, for a loved one, for a community - there's a sense of safety and security that allows us to to open and truly be ourselves. Trust is so fundamental to relating, and yet, can feel so hard to establish - and so easily broken. What does it mean to be worthy of trust, and how do we cultivate trusting relationships in our lives? And if that trust is broken, how do we recover, and allow ourselves to be open to trusting again? Let's have a conversation about trust - how to create it, maintain it, and rebuild it when it's gone.


Thursday, Sept 19th --> ""Power"" - Governing moments both ordinary and extraordinary - from the office, to the bedroom, to our friendships - our relationship with power often emerges from its imbalance. Sometimes we feel strong, influential, and ""better"" than others. And on the flipside, there are times when we can feel inferior, worthless or unsafe. Let's explore our relationship with our “power” — what happens when we abuse it OR it’s taken away (either by ourselves or others)? But what about our true, authentic power - the one where we don't feel inferior or superior to anyone - but rather, simply true to ourselves. What does it take - and how does it feel - to really stand there? 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
During our intimate dinners (7-10 max), our experienced hosts create a safe container for women to come together and talk with vulnerability and honesty about our most personal topics and emotions (e.g. self-confidence, fear, control).
After each dinner, we identify the key learnings and insights from the night and share them with our community so they, too can benefit from the experience. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.
We are currently hosting dinners in over 20 cities around the world. 
FAQs
Do attendees know each other?


Sometimes. But usually they don’t and that’s part of the magic. Coming into a place full of strangers to open up and share some of your most personal experiences is very powerful. No one there knows your history, you are a blank canvas. People won’t judge you or give you advice (unless you specifically ask for it). We are there to listen, share and connect.



Do I need to prepare for the Dinner?


A little bit! Your host will send all the details of the night via email, including a few questions for you to reflect upon prior the Dinner. All Dinners start with an intimate set of introductions, where each guest share her stories and is deeply heard.



How much are the dinners and what’s included?


Dinners are $15 and they include a healthy and yummy meal. We invite our guests to bring one thing to drink (wine, flavored water, etc.). Note that we are NOT making any profit from these evening and the fee only covers the cost.



Do the meals follow certain dietary guidelines? 


Our hosts will always ensure there are vegetarian options available. If you have specific dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate with your host at least 1.5 weeks in advance.



How do you keep confidentiality?


We include a vow of confidentiality in our invitation, and reiterate the importance of confidentiality at the start of each dinner. We create a strong container of trust and integrity, and expect the same of all of our participants.



What makes DC different from a women’s circles?


Our secret is our hosts and the stories we tell! Our dinners are led by professional moderators, researchers and facilitators all around the world. Brilliant women with years of experience conducting challenging conversations amongst diverse groups of people. We’re less about the woo-woo, and more about the raw, real and impactful conversations with tangible insights for our guests and community to take action and implement within their daily lives.



What do you mean when you say “women”?


Anyone that is female identifying. Inclusivity is one of our core values! We welcome women of all ages, colors, religions and backgrounds. If you are male identifying and would love to attend a dinner, let’s talk.



What’s your cancelation policy?

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
Enjoy the rest of the summer, and see you all on Sunday, August 25th!

 During this intimate workshop hosted by Ana Lygia, you will taste wines and learn to make a calming oxymel. This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!

CHARLES SPRINGFIELD is a certified sommelier, wine educator and book author in New York City. He specializes in matching the right wines with the right people and the right occasions: teaching wine classes, hosting wine events and promoting overall wine appreciation.
Prior to falling headfirst into the wine business, Charles worked as a journalist and in public relations. Now he is using his unique approach to marketing communications, “life styling” experience and his love of wine to provide guidance on appreciating, understanding and enjoying wine in ways people never imaged possible.
Most recently, Charles has worked with a wide range of brands and companies including New York Vintners, Veuve Clicquot, The House of Burgundy, Wine.com, Adega Wines and Spirits, The Wine Riot and Corkbuzz Wine Studio. In 2017, he was featured as one of the Top 40 Black/African American Sommeliers in the country by LinkedIn. In early 2018, he launched a YouTube channel Maneuvering Wine with Style focused on all-things wine and wine-related.  The Less Is More Approach to Wine is his first book.","America/New_York",2019-08-09 01:00:00,2019-08-09 01:00:00,640,426,40.712775,-74.005973,"United States","new york city","wine"

 During this intimate workshop hosted by Ana Lygia, you will taste wines and learn to make a calming oxymel. This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.

Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dinner Confidential's mission is to help build a world where women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.
We explore the full spectrum of the feminine experience through storytelling and community. Each month we investigate a different social topic globally (i.e.: Failure, Sexuality, Courage etc) through intimate dinners and then share the learnings with our community. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.

Our SUMMER Topics:

Thursday, July 18th ""Anger"" --> We all know the feeling. Whether political or personal, something happens that sparks a flame inside of you, you feel your blood begin to boil. It's heated, it's powerful, and it can feel all consuming. Many of us are seasoned in repressing our anger, we pretend it does not exist. Perhaps some of us live in a state of perpetual anger - it is the lens through which we view the world. Whatever it may be, our anger is real and it is valid. But how many of us feel we have a healthy relationship with this emotion? Let's have a conversation about anger - how it feels and how it shows up in our lives. 
Thursday, August 29th ""Trust"" --> When we feel trust - whether for ourselves, for a loved one, for a community - there's a sense of safety and security that allows us to to open and truly be ourselves. Trust is so fundamental to relating, and yet, can feel so hard to establish - and so easily broken. What does it mean to be worthy of trust, and how do we cultivate trusting relationships in our lives? And if that trust is broken, how do we recover, and allow ourselves to be open to trusting again? Let's have a conversation about trust - how to create it, maintain it, and rebuild it when it's gone.


Thursday, Sept 19th --> ""Power"" - Governing moments both ordinary and extraordinary - from the office, to the bedroom, to our friendships - our relationship with power often emerges from its imbalance. Sometimes we feel strong, influential, and ""better"" than others. And on the flipside, there are times when we can feel inferior, worthless or unsafe. Let's explore our relationship with our “power” — what happens when we abuse it OR it’s taken away (either by ourselves or others)? But what about our true, authentic power - the one where we don't feel inferior or superior to anyone - but rather, simply true to ourselves. What does it take - and how does it feel - to really stand there? 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
During our intimate dinners (7-10 max), our experienced hosts create a safe container for women to come together and talk with vulnerability and honesty about our most personal topics and emotions (e.g. self-confidence, fear, control).
After each dinner, we identify the key learnings and insights from the night and share them with our community so they, too can benefit from the experience. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.
We are currently hosting dinners in over 20 cities around the world. 
FAQs
Do attendees know each other?


Sometimes. But usually they don’t and that’s part of the magic. Coming into a place full of strangers to open up and share some of your most personal experiences is very powerful. No one there knows your history, you are a blank canvas. People won’t judge you or give you advice (unless you specifically ask for it). We are there to listen, share and connect.



Do I need to prepare for the Dinner?


A little bit! Your host will send all the details of the night via email, including a few questions for you to reflect upon prior the Dinner. All Dinners start with an intimate set of introductions, where each guest share her stories and is deeply heard.



How much are the dinners and what’s included?


Dinners are $15 and they include a healthy and yummy meal. We invite our guests to bring one thing to drink (wine, flavored water, etc.). Note that we are NOT making any profit from these evening and the fee only covers the cost.



Do the meals follow certain dietary guidelines? 


Our hosts will always ensure there are vegetarian options available. If you have specific dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate with your host at least 1.5 weeks in advance.



How do you keep confidentiality?


We include a vow of confidentiality in our invitation, and reiterate the importance of confidentiality at the start of each dinner. We create a strong container of trust and integrity, and expect the same of all of our participants.



What makes DC different from a women’s circles?


Our secret is our hosts and the stories we tell! Our dinners are led by professional moderators, researchers and facilitators all around the world. Brilliant women with years of experience conducting challenging conversations amongst diverse groups of people. We’re less about the woo-woo, and more about the raw, real and impactful conversations with tangible insights for our guests and community to take action and implement within their daily lives.



What do you mean when you say “women”?


Anyone that is female identifying. Inclusivity is one of our core values! We welcome women of all ages, colors, religions and backgrounds. If you are male identifying and would love to attend a dinner, let’s talk.



What’s your cancelation policy?


We put a lot of love and effort into these dinners so please do your best to avoid a last minute cancellation. If you need to cancel, try to find a replacement. All cancellations made less than one week in advance can’t be refunded.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!

 During this intimate workshop hosted by Ana Lygia, you will taste wines and learn to make a calming oxymel. This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.

For some employers, diversity and making their workforces more inclusive was just something that they felt was the moral thing to do. For other employers, it was legally compelled. Fortunately, more employers are discovering that the more diverse and inclusive their workforce, the more productive is that workforce.
Join your fellow university relations, talent acquisition, and other human resource leaders from corporate, non-profit, and government organizations on Thursday, December 12th at Ernst & Young's new, world headquarters across the Hudson River from Manhattan for a highly interactive, collegial, and informative day of learning. It is goal of the organizer, College Recruiter, that you'll leave with a roadmap for how you and your organization can not only survive, but also thrive by enhancing your existing diversity and inclusion talent acquisition tactics and strategies.
Due to the generosity of our host, Ernst and Young, we are able to bring this event -- our 17th College Recruiting Bootcamp -- to you at a far lower cost than comparable conferences.

Dinner Confidential's mission is to help build a world where women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.
We explore the full spectrum of the feminine experience through storytelling and community. Each month we investigate a different social topic globally (i.e.: Failure, Sexuality, Courage etc) through intimate dinners and then share the learnings with our community. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.

Our SUMMER Topics:

Thursday, July 18th ""Anger"" --> We all know the feeling. Whether political or personal, something happens that sparks a flame inside of you, you feel your blood begin to boil. It's heated, it's powerful, and it can feel all consuming. Many of us are seasoned in repressing our anger, we pretend it does not exist. Perhaps some of us live in a state of perpetual anger - it is the lens through which we view the world. Whatever it may be, our anger is real and it is valid. But how many of us feel we have a healthy relationship with this emotion? Let's have a conversation about anger - how it feels and how it shows up in our lives. 
Thursday, August 29th ""Trust"" --> When we feel trust - whether for ourselves, for a loved one, for a community - there's a sense of safety and security that allows us to to open and truly be ourselves. Trust is so fundamental to relating, and yet, can feel so hard to establish - and so easily broken. What does it mean to be worthy of trust, and how do we cultivate trusting relationships in our lives? And if that trust is broken, how do we recover, and allow ourselves to be open to trusting again? Let's have a conversation about trust - how to create it, maintain it, and rebuild it when it's gone.


Thursday, Sept 19th --> ""Power"" - Governing moments both ordinary and extraordinary - from the office, to the bedroom, to our friendships - our relationship with power often emerges from its imbalance. Sometimes we feel strong, influential, and ""better"" than others. And on the flipside, there are times when we can feel inferior, worthless or unsafe. Let's explore our relationship with our “power” — what happens when we abuse it OR it’s taken away (either by ourselves or others)? But what about our true, authentic power - the one where we don't feel inferior or superior to anyone - but rather, simply true to ourselves. What does it take - and how does it feel - to really stand there? 

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
During our intimate dinners (7-10 max), our experienced hosts create a safe container for women to come together and talk with vulnerability and honesty about our most personal topics and emotions (e.g. self-confidence, fear, control).
After each dinner, we identify the key learnings and insights from the night and share them with our community so they, too can benefit from the experience. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.
We are currently hosting dinners in over 20 cities around the world. 
FAQs
Do attendees know each other?


Sometimes. But usually they don’t and that’s part of the magic. Coming into a place full of strangers to open up and share some of your most personal experiences is very powerful. No one there knows your history, you are a blank canvas. People won’t judge you or give you advice (unless you specifically ask for it). We are there to listen, share and connect.



Do I need to prepare for the Dinner?


A little bit! Your host will send all the details of the night via email, including a few questions for you to reflect upon prior the Dinner. All Dinners start with an intimate set of introductions, where each guest share her stories and is deeply heard.



How much are the dinners and what’s included?


Dinners are $15 and they include a healthy and yummy meal. We invite our guests to bring one thing to drink (wine, flavored water, etc.). Note that we are NOT making any profit from these evening and the fee only covers the cost.



Do the meals follow certain dietary guidelines? 


Our hosts will always ensure there are vegetarian options available. If you have specific dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate with your host at least 1.5 weeks in advance.



How do you keep confidentiality?


We include a vow of confidentiality in our invitation, and reiterate the importance of confidentiality at the start of each dinner. We create a strong container of trust and integrity, and expect the same of all of our participants.



What makes DC different from a women’s circles?


Our secret is our hosts and the stories we tell! Our dinners are led by professional moderators, researchers and facilitators all around the world. Brilliant women with years of experience conducting challenging conversations amongst diverse groups of people. We’re less about the woo-woo, and more about the raw, real and impactful conversations with tangible insights for our guests and community to take action and implement within their daily lives.



What do you mean when you say “women”?


Anyone that is female identifying. Inclusivity is one of our core values! We welcome women of all ages, colors, religions and backgrounds. If you are male identifying and would love to attend a dinner, let’s talk.



What’s your cancelation policy?


We put a lot of love and effort into these dinners so please do your best to avoid a last minute cancellation. If you need to cancel, try to find a replacement. All cancellations made less than one week in advance can’t be refunded.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
Enjoy the rest of the summer, and see you all on Sunday, August 25th!

During the tasting, you will have the opportunity to taste and contrast 6 different Rosés (one of the wines will be ordered exclusively for the event). In concert with the wines, we will provide delicious bites to enjoy with each glass.
As you explore the different Rosés, we aim to help you learn wine basics such as varietal, tasting techniques, region/history, and everyday-practical wine appreciation tips. Through our discussions and tasting journey, you will learn how to best pair your wines with food and situations. i.e., Which ones are beach and park friendly. We are kidding, kinda. Our events are casual and meant to be fun and instructive. Sip and chill vibes. So join us for some tasty drinks and bites in the garden under tealights.

 During this intimate workshop hosted by Ana Lygia, you will taste wines and learn to make a calming oxymel. This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.

Dinner Confidential's mission is to help build a world where women feel more free, loving, connected and courageous.
We explore the full spectrum of the feminine experience through storytelling and community. Each month we investigate a different social topic globally (i.e.: Failure, Sexuality, Courage etc) through intimate dinners and then share the learnings with our community. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.

Our SUMMER Topics:

Thursday, July 18th ""Anger"" --> We all know the feeling. Whether political or personal, something happens that sparks a flame inside of you, you feel your blood begin to boil. It's heated, it's powerful, and it can feel all consuming. Many of us are seasoned in repressing our anger, we pretend it does not exist. Perhaps some of us live in a state of perpetual anger - it is the lens through which we view the world. Whatever it may be, our anger is real and it is valid. But how many of us feel we have a healthy relationship with this emotion? Let's have a conversation about anger - how it feels and how it shows up in our lives. 
Thursday, August 29th ""Trust"" --> When we feel trust - whether for ourselves, for a loved one, for a community - there's a sense of safety and security that allows us to to open and truly be ourselves. Trust is so fundamental to relating, and yet, can feel so hard to establish - and so easily broken. What does it mean to be worthy of trust, and how do we cultivate trusting relationships in our lives? And if that trust is broken, how do we recover, and allow ourselves to be open to trusting again? Let's have a conversation about trust - how to create it, maintain it, and rebuild it when it's gone.


Thursday, Sept 19th --> ""Power"" - Governing moments both ordinary and extraordinary - from the office, to the bedroom, to our friendships - our relationship with power often emerges from its imbalance. Sometimes we feel strong, influential, and ""better"" than others. And on the flipside, there are times when we can feel inferior, worthless or unsafe. Let's explore our relationship with our “power” — what happens when we abuse it OR it’s taken away (either by ourselves or others)? But what about our true, authentic power - the one where we don't feel inferior or superior to anyone - but rather, simply true to ourselves. What does it take - and how does it feel - to really stand there?

During our intimate dinners (7-10 max), our experienced hosts create a safe container for women to come together and talk with vulnerability and honesty about our most personal topics and emotions (e.g. self-confidence, fear, control).
After each dinner, we identify the key learnings and insights from the night and share them with our community so they, too can benefit from the experience. You can read our stories via Medium or our website.
We are currently hosting dinners in over 20 cities around the world. 
FAQs
Do attendees know each other?


Sometimes. But usually they don’t and that’s part of the magic. Coming into a place full of strangers to open up and share some of your most personal experiences is very powerful. No one there knows your history, you are a blank canvas. People won’t judge you or give you advice (unless you specifically ask for it). We are there to listen, share and connect.



Do I need to prepare for the Dinner?


A little bit! Your host will send all the details of the night via email, including a few questions for you to reflect upon prior the Dinner. All Dinners start with an intimate set of introductions, where each guest share her stories and is deeply heard.



How much are the dinners and what’s included?


Dinners are $15 and they include a healthy and yummy meal. We invite our guests to bring one thing to drink (wine, flavored water, etc.). Note that we are NOT making any profit from these evening and the fee only covers the cost.



Do the meals follow certain dietary guidelines? 


Our hosts will always ensure there are vegetarian options available. If you have specific dietary restrictions, be sure to communicate with your host at least 1.5 weeks in advance.



How do you keep confidentiality?


We include a vow of confidentiality in our invitation, and reiterate the importance of confidentiality at the start of each dinner. We create a strong container of trust and integrity, and expect the same of all of our participants.



What makes DC different from a women’s circles?


Our secret is our hosts and the stories we tell! Our dinners are led by professional moderators, researchers and facilitators all around the world. Brilliant women with years of experience conducting challenging conversations amongst diverse groups of people. We’re less about the woo-woo, and more about the raw, real and impactful conversations with tangible insights for our guests and community to take action and implement within their daily lives.



What do you mean when you say “women”?


Anyone that is female identifying. Inclusivity is one of our core values! We welcome women of all ages, colors, religions and backgrounds. If you are male identifying and would love to attend a dinner, let’s talk.

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
Enjoy the rest of the summer, and see you all on Sunday, August 25th!
