 During this intimate workshop hosted by Ana Lygia, you will taste wines and learn to make a calming oxymel. This ancient medicinal is composed of an herb infused honey and vinegar potion, and makes a delicious and versatile medicine. Oxymels can be used as the base for an herbal soda or mocktail, which we will be sampling at the DIY station. This classic preparation can also be taken by the spoonful, or incorporated into the culinary arts in creative ways such as in a salad dressings or sauces. We will be using a selection of herbs to soothe and support the nervous system, addressing such issues as anxiety and chronic stress or tension. From these carefully curated herbs you will chose one or more plant to work with. Once selected, you will be guided in creating your oxymel infusion by steeping your new herbal ally in honey, vinegar, and intention. This creation will be yours to take home with instructions on how and when to strain the concoction, and ways to enjoy its sweet medicine in your care practices.

Dear Friends!
On Sunday, August 25th, 2019, at 5:00 p.m., Remy and I invite you for a one-of-a-kind evening of BRILLIANT BASSOON, featuring both beloved and seldom-heard works for bassoon and keyboard by Vivaldi, Telemann, Mozart, Saint-Saens, Ravel, Dutilleux, and Boutry. An Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and priest, Antonio Vivaldi (1678-1741) composed over 500 concertos, about 350 of which are for a solo instrument and strings. After the violin, for which he wrote some 230 concertos including his celebrated Four Seasons, bassoon is the instrument for which Vivaldi wrote the most number of concertos - namely, 39 of them, two of which are incomplete. Our program will open with Vivaldi's festive Bassoon Concerto in F Major, RV 491 (ca. 1720-24) in stil galant with two lively and virtuosic outer movements framing an exquisitely lyrical and expressive middle movement. A contemporary of Vivaldi, Georg Philipp Telemann (1681-1767) was one of the leading and most prolific German composers of his time - possibly more famous than Bach in his day! - who wrote both sacred and secular music, vocal and instrumental music, including opera, incorporating German, French, and Italian national styles. His beautifully melancholy Bassoon Sonata in F minor, TWV 41 (1728-29) is considered to be one of his most popular works, laid out in the traditioanl sonata de chiesa format (slow-fast-slow-fast), opening with a wistful Triste, followed by an exuberant Allegro, full of sparkling ornaments, a short but deeply heartfelt Andante, and a brilliantly virtuosic finale, Vivace. An Aquarian Genius, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756-1791) began to compose at age 5 and was famously dubbed the ""eternal child"" for his precocious Talent, having composed over 600 masterworks in the symphonic, concertante, operatic, chamber, solo keyboard, and choral music. Mozart's sunny Bassoon Concerto in B-flat Major, K. 191 (1774), composed when he was just 18 years old, was his very first concerto for a wind instrument and is the most often performed work in the entire bassoon repertory, cast in three contrasting movements: a radiant opening Allegro, a slow and sublime Andante ma Adagio, and an elegant finale, Rondo: Tempo di menuetto. The French Romantic composer, organist, conductor, and pianist, Camille Saint-Saens (1835-1921) was a child prodigy and a prolific composer of chamber music whose works were generally couched within the Classical tradition. His Neo-Classical Sonata for bassoon and piano in G Major, op. 168 (1921), written in the last year of his life, sparkles with many pastoral and humorous moments, showcasing simpler melodies and leaner textures than are found in his earlier, more bravura chamber works. Regarded as France's leading composer, pianist, orchestrator and conductor, Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) embraced an eclectic musical style, incorporating elements of Neo-Baroque, Neo-Classical, Neo-Romantic, French Impressionist, and Jazz styles. His exotic Piece en forme de Habanera (1907), originally for bass voice and piano, was inspired by the slow, sultry Spanish dance, called the Habanera, and was later transcribed for cello and piano from which several other arrangments have been made, such as the lesser-played version for bassoon and piano. Henri Dutilleux (1916-2013) was a French composer actively mainly in the second half of the 20th century who followed in the tradition of Ravel, Debussy, Roussel, and Messiaen, but in his own idiosyncratic style. His Neo-Baroque Sarabande et cortege for bassoon and piano (1942), written in the early part of his career, pays homage to Debussy's unique French Impressionist style and Ravel's unique textural soundworld, interweaving lyrical melodies with glittering passagework for the bassoon. A currently living French composer, virtuoso pianist, arranger, and conductor, Roger Boutry (b. 1932) studied at the Paris Conservatoire with Nadia Boulanger and won the prestigious Prix de Rome in 195 for his cantata, ""On ne badine pas avec l'amour."" Influenced by Debussy and Ravel, his music is known for its expressive melodies such as we find in his delightful, jazz-inspired Interferences for bassoon and piano (1972) full of flair and virtuosic fireworks for both players alike. Don't miss this unique salon in tribute to the Brilliant Bassoon!
Enjoy the rest of the summer, and see you all on Sunday, August 25th!
