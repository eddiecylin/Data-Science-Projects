About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z",828,315,"40.712775","-74.005973","United States","new york city","cocktail"

Culturally dynamic and art-centric paint parties we call Art & Cocktail Therapy,  we avoid the average corny paint n sip art, and find ways to bring out the best in each guest, conjuring their inner Basquiat, Keith Haring, Picasso or Matisse. We guide you to easily create an acrylic on canvas painting to take home that you’ll be proud to put up.
Quick breakdown of the experience:
Guests will enter the studio to the sounds of current and classic beats, sit wherever they like, with all the paint supplies and easels in front of them. They can choose from a variety of thematically curated craft cocktails or sangria, which will be refreshed as requested. 
We discuss the painting that we’ve chosen to teach, its cultural or historical context, and ways to vary upon the theme and where best to freestyle. Every part of the painting is broken down into in a series of simple steps, basing each form on familiar shapes or letters, while explaining colors and the dos and don’ts of paint mixing.
As the paintings come to a finish, guests have found ways to create in their own language, with a true work of art to take home, to remember and embody the whole experience.
Everyone socializes and finish up at an organic pace, taking pictures, clowning, dancing, and happily milling out without feeling rushed.
We have a 2pm class and a 6pm class. Check the website www.chicassostudio.com for more details.

As Don the Beachcomber famously quipped, ""What one rum can do, three can do better.” He created a style of cocktail that had never been seen - or imagined - in his ""Rhum Rhapsodies"" which combined multiple spirits to capture the best of what each had to offer, laying the foundation for layered, complex and richly flavored cocktails.

CERTIFICATION: RUM EXPERT LEVEL 1

Class Description:


From Donn the Beachcomber's ""Rhum Rhapsodies"" -  cocktails that blended multiple spirits and components in a way that had never been attempted up until that point, to the way bartenders of today are incorporating newly available ingredients such as agave, yuzu, and fat washing into drinks. The realm of Tiki cocktails proves time and time again to be a hotbed of cocktail innovation, inspiring bartenders to experiment with a spectrum of flavors and applications that seldom appear on other styles of cocktail.
In the realm of presentation, Tiki cocktails have led the way in attention to detail in terms of elaborate vessels, garnishes, and the use of smoke, fire, and the like.  The adage “The feast starts with the eyes” speaks to the role 
the appearance of a cocktail plays in creating anticipation and impact in a cocktail.  In this class we will cover specialty ice for Tiki, garnish cuts, and more.


The class will conclude with an optional exam for those wishing to obtain the NYCE Rum Level 1 Certification, which grants access to the next level of Rum Tasting and trainings on 4 sub categories:
Raw Cane - Agiardiente, Cachcaca, and Agricole

RUM ACADEMY CLASS 1:
History and Classification: ""Know Thy Rums""

Students will walk away armed with a solid understanding of the category and a base of knowledge from which to continue an intelligent exploration and study of the world of rum.
 
Class Inspirations:
As Don the Beachcomber famously quipped, ""What one rum can do, three can do better.” He created a style of cocktail that had never been seen - or imagined - in his ""Rhum Rhapsodies"" which combined multiple spirits to capture the best of what each had to offer, laying the foundation for layered, complex and richly flavored cocktails.

CERTIFICATION: RUM EXPERT LEVEL 1
 
Class Description:
From Donn the Beachcomber's ""Rhum Rhapsodies"" -  cocktails that blended multiple spirits and components in a way that had never been attempted up until that point, to the way bartenders of today are incorporating newly available ingredients such as agave, yuzu, and fat washing into drinks. The realm of Tiki cocktails proves time and time again to be a hotbed of cocktail innovation, inspiring bartenders to experiment with a spectrum of flavors and applications that seldom appear on other styles of cocktail.
In the realm of presentation, Tiki cocktails have led the way in attention to detail in terms of elaborate vessels, garnishes, and the use of smoke, fire, and the like.  The adage “The feast starts with the eyes” speaks to the role 
the appearance of a cocktail plays in creating anticipation and impact in a cocktail.  In this class we will cover specialty ice for Tiki, garnish cuts, and more.
The class will conclude with an optional exam for those wishing to obtain the NYCE Rum Level 1 Certification, which grants access to the next level of Rum Tasting and trainings on 4 sub categories:
 
Raw Cane - Agiardiente, Cachcaca, and Agricole
English and Navy Style Rums

Rum Connoisseurship -  Extra Aged, Single Still, Rare and Limited Rums

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.
