With ready access to quality water from the Ridgewood Reservoir, plentiful hops grown in upstate New York, and a thriving German immigrant population, it's no wonder why Bushwick was such a brewing powerhouse. So it's fitting that we'll end at one of the area's newest breweries, Interboro, to toast the triumphant return of brewing to Brooklyn!

When is last call?
Brewers will be instructed to stop serving beer 10 minutes before the end of the session.
Who will be pouring the beer?
For Beers With(out) Beards we think it is especially important that the women brewer or owner behind the beer is on hand to pour beer, answer questions, and start conversations. We have worked our hardest to make sure that the female brewer or founder will be present.
Which beers will be served?
The beers at the fest are extremely fresh and limited release, so it's hard to predict brewing schedules well in advance. However, we'll release the beer lists in the week leading up to the fest as they become available.
Will there be enough beer?
We bring enough beer to our festivals that the majority of breweries will be pouring beer for the entire fest. However, due to their popularity, some breweries will kick their kegs before last call, typically within the last 45 minutes. We do our best to avoid this, but we also want to avoid wasting beer.
Other FAQs
Will you have merchandise?
Absolutely. Our festival tasters and official teku were designed by London-based Sam Taylor. 
How do I apply for media passes?
Send an email to Kenny at kenny@hopculture.com. Please include the name of your publication or account and your estimated reach.
The Rules
Please DO NOT open any cans or bottles during the festivals. For legal reasons, they will be confiscated.
It's a beer fest and we want everyone to have a good time, but anyone that's visibly intoxicated will be asked to leave.
Tickets are non-refundable and subject to applicable taxes and fees, as well as changes. All sales are final, no exceptions!
