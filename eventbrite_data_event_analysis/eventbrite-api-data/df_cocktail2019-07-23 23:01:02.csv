About King Manor
King Manor fosters civic awareness, critical thinking, and empathy by using Rufus King’s life and times as a jumping-off point to explore the ramifications of the past on the present. Through a variety of educational, artistic, and cultural programming, visitors come to see history as an on-going process of which they are a part.
Rufus King (1755 - 1827) purchased King Manor in 1805 after a distinguished career: framer and signer of the U.S. Constitution, U.S. Senator, ambassador to England, and vocal anti-slavery advocate. King was well-known in his times for his strong stance against slavery, and the apex of King’s political career was his dramatic speeches to the Senate opposing the Missouri Compromise and denouncing slavery as ""against the laws of nature and of God.""
Opened to the public in 1900, King Manor Museum is one of the earliest historic house museums in the United States. King Manor is a New York City Landmark, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the centerpiece of King Park, the remaining 11 acres of the original farm and estate. The only green space in downtown Jamaica, King Park is a heavily-used public space and rich archaeological site.","America/New_York","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z","2019-09-18T00:00:00Z",828,315,"40.712775","-74.005973","United States","new york city","cocktail"

About Artists:
Moguai was inspired by the spherical, experimental sounds emanating from the Rhine metropolis and, at the same time, found his way as a DJ into the rave scene of the Ruhr and beyond. This was the era of vast warehouse gatherings with gigantic sound systems turned up to the max. The shockwaves were so severe, that traces of them can still be felt and heard today. At the epicentre: Moguai. His sound, however, does more than just shake and disturb...the Moguai sound is different. Lets add another M word to the collection - Magical! Even in the early years, with the bass and the beats banging all over the place, Moguai was creating distinct patterns and soundscapes, inviting those listening and dancing into the exclusive aural experience of the man behind the decks.

Riggi & Piros  [Anthony Riggi and James Piros] met in the 1st grade, and never looked back. This booming dj/producer duo started djing in NYC clubs at 16, producing at 17, and now a mere 21 & 20 years of age. In 2015 the due release teased there first solo production, Knightlife under Tiësto’s Musical Freedom label in early November. The single came as a follow up release to their June 2015 collaboration with ZAXX entitled “Alpha” on the same label the duo also had the honor of releasing their own remix of one of 2015’s biggest records. The Riggi & Piros remix of “Secrets” Drawing inspiration from Hardwell, Tiësto, and Martin Garrix, they released their first track ‘Animals Remix’. With one years’ production experience under their belt, the duo charted their first single in the Beatport Top 20 with their remix of ‘Surge’ by Clockwork. Prior to their Musical Freedom releases, their biggest track ‘Keep Rockin,’ which was released by Armada Music, charted #2 on Beatport’s Progressive House Charts. Since then Riggi & Piros have had had huge remixes for Chainsmokers, Tiësto, Borgeous, KSHMR, Clockwork, & Borgore, not to mention collabs with Deorro, Borgore, Borgeous, Lil Jon, & Ookay just to name a few. 2017 is certainly shaping up to be a big one for this young talented Duo.

His tracks have been played by Carl Cox, Richie Hawtin, Marco Carola, Jamie Jones, Danny Tenaglia, Dubfire, and Stacey Pullen -who are not only some of the most respected artists in the industry but inspirations in Barrios’ musical upbringing.
Rafa has recently remixed artists Kim English, Chus & Ceballos, Boris, Gabriel Ananda, and Danny Tenaglia. All of which led to his production of hits’ Flip Flop and Woohoo- both on Sola, that were in Beatport’s Top 10 in 2018.
The past few years he has been performing in Barcelona, Madrid, Amsterdam, Bali, Belgium, Montreal, Miami Florida, Brooklyn New York, Ecuador, and Peru- just to name a few. Currently, you can catch him performing under elite labels Elrow and Repopulate Mars.
