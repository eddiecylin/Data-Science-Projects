Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will be answered quickly.
When
Nov 10, 11, 17, 18: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. The instructor will personally review code and give feedback on course assignments. Approximately 300 short answer questions with detailed solutions will be available. 
Syllabus
Before the Course: 
Students will need to set aside 20 - 40 hours to set up the programming environment and to complete a thorough overview of the fundamentals of Python. Two additional online classes will be held before the bootcamp to ensure all students are completing this assignment.
Day 1: Introduction to Pandas - Selecting Subsets of Data
Perhaps the most popular and widely used open-source data wrangling tool of the times, the Pandas library and its main data structures, the Series and DataFrame will be introduced.  Selecting subsets of data is a very common yet confusing task that must be mastered in order to be effective with Pandas.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data (as described by Hadley Wickham) provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. 
Post-Course Education
It is vital to continue practicing the skills covered immediately upon course completion. Three additional open-ended data analysis assignments will be given to students to help practice their new skillset. Ted will provide detailed feedback for all the extra assignments.
Additionally, a specific curriculum is given to the students to help guide them towards an entry-level position as a data analysts or data scientist.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist

Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 11.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 2.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly

Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumers privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
NOTE: this event is part of our new Mission AI programming and will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom . Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots.]
What We'll Cover
Guest Speaker: Henri L. Greenidge, Esq., Policy Advisor, East Coast Gov. & Communications Relations, Cruise Automation (a subsidiary of General Motors)[/caption] Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will be answered quickly.
When
Nov 10, 11, 17, 18: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. The instructor will personally review code and give feedback on course assignments. Approximately 300 short answer questions with detailed solutions will be available. 
Syllabus
Before the Course: 
Students will need to set aside 20 - 40 hours to set up the programming environment and to complete a thorough overview of the fundamentals of Python. Two additional online classes will be held before the bootcamp to ensure all students are completing this assignment.
Day 1: Introduction to Pandas - Selecting Subsets of Data
Perhaps the most popular and widely used open-source data wrangling tool of the times, the Pandas library and its main data structures, the Series and DataFrame will be introduced.  Selecting subsets of data is a very common yet confusing task that must be mastered in order to be effective with Pandas.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data (as described by Hadley Wickham) provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. 
Post-Course Education
It is vital to continue practicing the skills covered immediately upon course completion. Three additional open-ended data analysis assignments will be given to students to help practice their new skillset. Ted will provide detailed feedback for all the extra assignments.
Additionally, a specific curriculum is given to the students to help guide them towards an entry-level position as a data analysts or data scientist.
Instructor
Ted Petrou is the author of  Pandas Cookbook and founder of both Dunder Data and the Houston Data Science Meetup group. He worked as a data scientist at Schlumberger where he spent the vast majority of his time exploring data and building data products. Ted received his Master's degree in statistics from Rice University and used his analytical skills to play poker professionally and teach math before becoming a data scientist. ","2018-11-10T14:00:00Z","2018-11-18T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

Nov 12 - 16: 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. The instructor will personally review code and give feedback on course assignments. Approximately 300 short answer questions with detailed solutions will be available. 
Syllabus
Before the Course: 
Students will need to set aside 20 - 40 hours to set up the programming environment and to complete a thorough overview of the fundamentals of Python. Two additional online classes will be held before the bootcamp to ensure all students are completing this assignment.
Day 1: Introduction to Pandas - Selecting Subsets of Data
Perhaps the most popular and widely used open-source data wrangling tool of the times, the Pandas library and its main data structures, the Series and DataFrame will be introduced.  Selecting subsets of data is a very common yet confusing task that must be mastered in order to be effective with Pandas.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data (as described by Hadley Wickham) provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. 
Post-Course Education
It is vital to continue practicing the skills covered immediately upon course completion. Three additional open-ended data analysis assignments will be given to students to help practice their new skillset. Ted will provide detailed feedback for all the extra assignments.
Additionally, a specific curriculum is given to the students to help guide them towards an entry-level position as a data analysts or data scientist.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge.

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly

Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumers privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
NOTE: this event is part of our new Mission AI programming and will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom . Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots.]
What We'll Cover
Guest Speaker: Henri L. Greenidge, Esq., Policy Advisor, East Coast Gov. & Communications Relations, Cruise Automation (a subsidiary of General Motors)[/caption] Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

【Time】10/18 (Thu) 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM
【Location】Microsoft Store 6th Floor 677 5th Ave, New York, 10022
【Talks】
Lydia will give a talk on “Storytelling with Data”. 
Emily will talk about A/B testing. 
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.

Through this intense, 6-week program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-9: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 10-11, 17-18 - 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Nov 20 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-11: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 12-16, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Nov 17 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.

How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).

This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights

Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?

The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.

Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?

In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:


How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

【Time】10/18 (Thu) 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM
【Location】Microsoft Store 6th Floor 677 5th Ave, New York, 10022
【Talks】
Lydia will give a talk on “Storytelling with Data”. 
Emily will talk about A/B testing. 
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.

Through this intense, 6-week program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-9: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 10-11, 17-18 - 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Nov 20 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 11.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 2.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

Join Cyrus Farivar and Meredith Broussard for an engaging evening covering the cutting edges of technology in America.You are being watched. Whether through your phone or your car or your credit card, caught on a CCTV camera or tracked through your online viewing history, government agencies know where you are, and are quietly collecting your most intimate, mundane, and personal information. Is this even legal? HABEAS DATA shows how the explosive growth of surveillance technology has outpaced our understanding of the ethics, mores, and laws of privacy.Cyrus [suh-ROOS] Farivar is a Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica, and is also an author and radio producer. He is based in Oakland, California.In ARTIFICIAL UNINTELLIGENCE, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology—and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right.Data journalist Meredith Broussard is an assistant professor at the Arthur L.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service on October 24, 2018 with Sir Bill English, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand (see bio below). English was responsible for implementing the integrated data system (IDI) in New Zealand. Now agencies are using it across the board to implement evidence-based social investment decisions.
 
About Sir Bill English
Bill English was Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister from October 2008 to December 2016 and Prime Minister of New Zealand until the change of government in October 2017, prior to standing down from politics in March 2018.  Bill English guided the New Zealand economy through the global financial crisis to be one of the faster growing developed economies with sustainable government surpluses. He initiated tax reforms, partial floats of four government companies and financing the rebuild of Christchurch after the 2010 earthquakes.  As Minister for Infrastructure he set up the National Infrastructure Unit and initiated New Zealand's first PPP program.

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

【Time】10/18 (Thu) 6:30 PM - 8:30 PM
【Location】Microsoft Store 6th Floor 677 5th Ave, New York, 10022
【Talks】
Lydia will give a talk on “Storytelling with Data”. 
Emily will talk about A/B testing. 
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.

Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-9: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 10-11, 17-18 - 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Nov 20 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Join Cyrus Farivar and Meredith Broussard for an engaging evening covering the cutting edges of technology in America.You are being watched. Whether through your phone or your car or your credit card, caught on a CCTV camera or tracked through your online viewing history, government agencies know where you are, and are quietly collecting your most intimate, mundane, and personal information. Is this even legal? HABEAS DATA shows how the explosive growth of surveillance technology has outpaced our understanding of the ethics, mores, and laws of privacy.Cyrus [suh-ROOS] Farivar is a Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica, and is also an author and radio producer. He is based in Oakland, California.In ARTIFICIAL UNINTELLIGENCE, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology—and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right.Data journalist Meredith Broussard is an assistant professor at the Arthur L.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-10-16T13:00:00Z","2018-10-16T21:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.

A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.
Lydia Kan is a Data Scientist at Publicis North America, where she works on identify consumers’ insights using machine learning algorithms.

Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-9: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 10-11, 17-18 - 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Nov 20 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist

Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.

""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.
Lydia Kan is a Data Scientist at Publicis North America, where she works on identify consumers’ insights using machine learning algorithms. She collaborates with strategy, analytics, and creative team to develop a methodology to meet clients’ needs. She received her Master degree in Marketing Analytics from New York University, where she developed a passion for predictive analysis. She is fascinated by the stories of customers’ activities behind the data, which leads her to where she at now.

Through this intense, 6-week program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-9: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 10-11, 17-18 - 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Nov 20 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Join Cyrus Farivar and Meredith Broussard for an engaging evening covering the cutting edges of technology in America.You are being watched. Whether through your phone or your car or your credit card, caught on a CCTV camera or tracked through your online viewing history, government agencies know where you are, and are quietly collecting your most intimate, mundane, and personal information. Is this even legal? HABEAS DATA shows how the explosive growth of surveillance technology has outpaced our understanding of the ethics, mores, and laws of privacy.Cyrus [suh-ROOS] Farivar is a Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica, and is also an author and radio producer. He is based in Oakland, California.In ARTIFICIAL UNINTELLIGENCE, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology—and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right.Data journalist Meredith Broussard is an assistant professor at the Arthur L.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

Wagner Graduate School of Public Service on October 24, 2018 with Sir Bill English, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand (see bio below). English was responsible for implementing the integrated data system (IDI) in New Zealand. Now agencies are using it across the board to implement evidence-based social investment decisions.
 
About Sir Bill English
Bill English was Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister from October 2008 to December 2016 and Prime Minister of New Zealand until the change of government in October 2017, prior to standing down from politics in March 2018.  Bill English guided the New Zealand economy through the global financial crisis to be one of the faster growing developed economies with sustainable government surpluses. He initiated tax reforms, partial floats of four government companies and financing the rebuild of Christchurch after the 2010 earthquakes.  As Minister for Infrastructure he set up the National Infrastructure Unit and initiated New Zealand's first PPP program.

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.

""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.
Lydia Kan is a Data Scientist at Publicis North America, where she works on identify consumers’ insights using machine learning algorithms. She collaborates with strategy, analytics, and creative team to develop a methodology to meet clients’ needs. She received her Master degree in Marketing Analytics from New York University, where she developed a passion for predictive analysis. She is fascinated by the stories of customers’ activities behind the data, which leads her to where she at now.

Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-11: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 12-16, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Nov 17 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Join Cyrus Farivar and Meredith Broussard for an engaging evening covering the cutting edges of technology in America.You are being watched. Whether through your phone or your car or your credit card, caught on a CCTV camera or tracked through your online viewing history, government agencies know where you are, and are quietly collecting your most intimate, mundane, and personal information. Is this even legal? HABEAS DATA shows how the explosive growth of surveillance technology has outpaced our understanding of the ethics, mores, and laws of privacy.Cyrus [suh-ROOS] Farivar is a Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica, and is also an author and radio producer. He is based in Oakland, California.In ARTIFICIAL UNINTELLIGENCE, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology—and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right.Data journalist Meredith Broussard is an assistant professor at the Arthur L.

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.

""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning

Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-11: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 12-16, 9 a.m. - 5 p.m: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Nov 17 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Schedule
Oct 22 - Nov 4: Three weeks prior to live classes, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built complete with a simple AI.
Nov 5-9: One week prior to live classes, students will receive another assignment on the basics of the Pandas library with over 100 pages and 100 exercises. Two live online classes from 7 - 10 p.m. will be held on Nov 5th and 7th.
Nov 10-11, 17-18 - 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.: Live classes held near Times Square New York City. Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Nov 20 - Dec 2: Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Structure of Course
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.
Live Classes Syllabus
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small, yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn a simple yet effective process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest workflows for Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.
-----
""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.
Lydia Kan is a Data Scientist at Publicis North America, where she works on identify consumers’ insights using machine learning algorithms. She collaborates with strategy, analytics, and creative team to develop a methodology to meet clients’ needs. She received her Master degree in Marketing Analytics from New York University, where she developed a passion for predictive analysis. She is fascinated by the stories of customers’ activities behind the data, which leads her to where she at now.

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 12-16: Live classes held during the week near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-12T14:00:00Z","2018-11-16T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 10-11, 17-18: Live classes held on the weekends near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-10-16T13:00:00Z","2018-10-16T21:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.
-----
""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features. On her data science blog, hookedondata.org, she writes about topics ranging from managing the business challenges in data science to making R code faster to giving your first data science talk. She also recently released a course on DataCamp on working with categorical data in the tidyverse.
Lydia Kan is a Data Scientist at Publicis North America, where she works on identify consumers’ insights using machine learning algorithms. She collaborates with strategy, analytics, and creative team to develop a methodology to meet clients’ needs. She received her Master degree in Marketing Analytics from New York University, where she developed a passion for predictive analysis. She is fascinated by the stories of customers’ activities behind the data, which leads her to where she at now.

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 12-16: Live classes held during the week near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-12T14:00:00Z","2018-11-16T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Whether through your phone or your car or your credit card, caught on a CCTV camera or tracked through your online viewing history, government agencies know where you are, and are quietly collecting your most intimate, mundane, and personal information. Is this even legal?

Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 12-16: Live classes held during the week near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-12T14:00:00Z","2018-11-16T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 10-11, 17-18: Live classes held on the weekends near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-10T14:00:00Z","2018-11-18T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.
-----
""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】

Level 300 | Use Case How-To
Managing high availability and performance for relational databases is difficult when your application is query-intensive and deals with high volumes of concurrent traffic, leading to poor user engagement and customer experience. You can use an in-memory data store like Redis to improve availability and reduce the load on your primary relational database, however, a multi-database system can quickly become difficult to manage. AWS database services including Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon ElastiCache make it simpler to add a caching layer to your database, deliver high availability and performance, and leverage popular databases like MySQL and Redis without administrative tasks. Learn how to use Amazon RDS with Amazon ElastiCache by exploring 3 real-world use case architectures.





Learning Objectives

Learn how AWS database services, including Amazon RDS and Amazon ElastiCache, can work together to provide high availability and performance for query-intensive workloads and applications
See use cases demonstrating how ElastiCache for Redis and ElastiCache for Memcached can be used as a query cache for sub-millisecond latency to power the most demanding applications
Learn how Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora bring additional resiliency to your application by automating rapid failover, disaster recovery, and other administrative functions






Who Should Attend?
Developers, Architects, DBAs, DevOps roles, anyone managing relational databases for demanding applications

Level 300 | Use Case How-To
Managing high availability and performance for relational databases is difficult when your application is query-intensive and deals with high volumes of concurrent traffic, leading to poor user engagement and customer experience. You can use an in-memory data store like Redis to improve availability and reduce the load on your primary relational database, however, a multi-database system can quickly become difficult to manage. AWS database services including Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) and Amazon ElastiCache make it simpler to add a caching layer to your database, deliver high availability and performance, and leverage popular databases like MySQL and Redis without administrative tasks. Learn how to use Amazon RDS with Amazon ElastiCache by exploring 3 real-world use case architectures.





Learning Objectives

Learn how AWS database services, including Amazon RDS and Amazon ElastiCache, can work together to provide high availability and performance for query-intensive workloads and applications
See use cases demonstrating how ElastiCache for Redis and ElastiCache for Memcached can be used as a query cache for sub-millisecond latency to power the most demanding applications
Learn how Amazon RDS and Amazon Aurora bring additional resiliency to your application by automating rapid failover, disaster recovery, and other administrative functions






Who Should Attend?
Developers, Architects, DBAs, DevOps roles, anyone managing relational databases for demanding applications

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

9:00am: Warm breakfast and meaningful discussion
11:30am: Q&A

Agility Quadrant: Lead. Innovate. Disrupt.
AI is everywhere. It’s driving digital transformation and disruption across nearly every industry. What lies ahead for you and your AI initiatives? How will you become the next industry disruptor?

There is no one path for becoming a Digital Disruptor. Different organizations move up the Agility Quadrant in different ways. Every organization consumes and capitalizes on this transformative change differently. There are, however, best practices, prioritizations, and proven guidance that lay a strong foundation and map a plan for execution. Improved technical agility and organizational agility are the primary paths that an organization must execute against on the path to digital transformation and disruption.

Executive Panel
Join Steven Borg, 10th Magnitude VP of Innovation, along with Microsoft and industry Executives for this interactive discussion on industry trends, the power of AI everywhere, and practical ways you can lead to disrupt.

"956",65,2,49344178767,"2018-08-21T16:21:33Z",TRUE,FALSE,"en_US",FALSE,"data-driven product decisions: a hands-on workshop for product leaders","Want to build products that make an impact, driving growth and outcomes for your users?
This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-10-16T13:00:00Z","2018-10-16T21:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 12-16: Live classes held during the week near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-12T14:00:00Z","2018-11-16T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.
-----
""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features.

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 10-11, 17-18: Live classes held on the weekends near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-10T14:00:00Z","2018-11-18T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Whether through your phone or your car or your credit card, caught on a CCTV camera or tracked through your online viewing history, government agencies know where you are, and are quietly collecting your most intimate, mundane, and personal information. Is this even legal?

He is based in Oakland, California.In ARTIFICIAL UNINTELLIGENCE, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 10.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 1.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

"1039",64,2,49344178767,"2018-08-21T16:21:33Z",TRUE,FALSE,"en_US",FALSE,"data-driven product decisions: a hands-on workshop for product leaders","Want to build products that make an impact, driving growth and outcomes for your users?
This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-10-16T13:00:00Z","2018-10-16T21:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
Choose from the following options: 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.

""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features.

Through this intense, weeklong program you will begin your mastery of the skills necessary to manipulate, visualize, explore, and apply machine learning to datasets to extract valuable insights.
Expert Instructor
This course is taught by Ted Petrou, an expert at data exploration and machine learning using Python. He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 12-16: Live classes held during the week near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-12T14:00:00Z","2018-11-16T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available. During the week, students will work on completing two of these case studies.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
During the week: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 4: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-10T14:00:00Z","2018-11-18T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).

These classes are designed primarily for students and data scientists interested in getting started and sharpening their data science skills. 
Choose from the following options: 
I. $195 - Data wrangling I (R & RStudio) 
It is often said that data scientists spend eighty percent of their time wrangling the data. This class will give you the necessary tools to work with different data formats; transform the data; create new variables from existing features to make working with the data easier. [55min per class, 4 classes included]

II. $195 - Data visualization I (R & RStudio) Asking questions of the data and clearly visualizing your results is a crucial part of the scientific process of model building. Even if the questions are handed over and you are asked to simply build a predictive model, you should always start with the process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  and understand the features of the data before starting to build a model. Over time, you will develop your own EDA preferences and style when starting new projects. [55min per class, 4 classes included]
III. $375 - Senior Membership: Data wrangling & Data visualization
With the Senior Membership, you can take both classes back to back: data wrangling and data visualization. That's eight classes total. [55min per class, 8 classes included]

Abstract:  With his non-profit, DataKind, Jake Porway connects data scientists with social causes. Picture Doctors Without Borders for data nerds—with machine learning and AI engineers parachuting in to help the UN with humanitarian tasks, like tracking virus outbreaks using mobile data. “Data is like a bucket of crude oil,” Porway says. “Potentially great, but only if someone knows how to refine it (data scientists) and someone else has vehicles that will run on it (the social sector).” In this talk, Porway discusses the strategies of DataKind, its projects and the future of big data to service humanity. 
About the speakers: 

Jake Porway uses big data to tackle big social problems. As the founder of DataKind, he connects - and acts as an accessible bridge between - data scientists and not-for-profit companies, which often don’t have the know-how or resources to benefit from data analysis. A former New York Times Data Scientist, Porway wants all of humanity to benefit from the gains of big data and AI.

“Storytelling with Data” 
When it comes to storytelling with data, most people associate it with data visualization, exploratory analysis, presentation, or standard reports with a bunch of charts. However, many times the audiences are either lost in the middle of the presentation, getting confused with the graphs and resulted in no further actions after all the ‘interesting’ findings.To avoid these situations, the best practice is to tell a story with it. A lot of time we communicate the findings within the data, but it isn’t always so meaningful when there are only data insights. Instead, making data a pivotal point in an overarching story can enable us to guide the audience to what we want them to see and take action on. This talk will discuss how to make a good story that can bring data to life.Lydia is going to talk about using the appropriate graph for certain contents, directing audience’s thoughts with data visualization designs, and sending the message across by using actual case about consumer journey of products purchasing.

""A/B Testing Guidelines""
A classic A/B testing example you might have heard is changing the color of a button on a website. You randomly show 50% of people the old button, 50% of people the new, and measure the click or purchase rate to see if they improved. Sounds pretty simple right? Why exactly do you need a data scientist to analyze experiments?
Unfortunately, “generating numbers is easy; generating numbers you should trust is hard!” If you’ve been thinking about starting A/B testing at your company, have been doing it for a while but aren’t sure you’re following best practices, or are simply curious, this talk is for you. We don’t assume any level of A/B testing knowledge, statistics background, or programming experience.
We’ll begin with an introduction to A/B testing using actual examples from Etsy and DataCamp. Then we’ll dive into the main part of the talk, covering 10 guidelines for proper A/B Testing. Finally, we’ll end with a list of great resources so you can continue learning
【Speakers】
Emily Robinson is a Data Scientist at DataCamp, where she works on the growth team building an A/B Testing analytics system.  Previously, she was a Data Analyst at Etsy working with their search team to design, implement, and analyze experiments on the ranking algorithm, UI changes, and new features.

He is the author of Pandas Cookbook, a thorough step-by-step guide to accomplish a variety of data analysis tasks with Pandas. He is ranked in the top .1% of Stack Overflow users of all time. He is the author of the Python data exploration libraries Dexplo and Dexplot.
Small Class Size
This is a small class with at most 15 participants, which will allow everyone to fully participate and ask questions that will get answered quickly.
Live Class Dates
Nov 12-16: Live classes held during the week near Times Square from 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
Pre-Course Assignment
Upon registration, students will receive a very thorough, 200-page precourse assignment on the fundamentals of Python. There are over 100 exercises and a final project where a poker game is built with a rules-based artificial intelligence.
Online Classes
Nov 5th and 7th: Two online classes held from 7 - 10 p.m. Students will receive an assignment introducing them to the Pandas library and in particular how to select subsets of data. Over 100 pages and 100 exercises are available. 
Live Classes Syllabus
Over 1,000 pages of material, 400 questions with detailed solutions, several mini-projects, and a few major case studies will be available.
Day 1: Minimally Sufficient Pandas
The Pandas library is powerful yet confusing as there are always multiple operations to complete the same task. Students will learn a small yet powerful subset of Pandas that will allow them to complete many tasks without getting distracted by syntax. Students will also learn an efficient process for building a workflow in a Jupyter Notebook.
Day 2: Split-Apply-Combine
Insights within datasets are often hidden amongst different groupings. The split-apply-combine paradigm is the fundamental procedure to explore differences amongst distinct groups within datasets.
Day 3: Tidy Data
Real-world data is messy and not immediately available for aggregation, visualization or machine learning. Identifying messy data and transforming it into tidy data provides a structure to data for making further analysis easier.
Day 4: Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory data analysis is a process to gain understanding and intuition about datasets. Visualizations are the foundations of EDA and communicate the discoveries within. Matplotlib, the workhorse for building visualizations will be covered, followed by pandas effortless interface to it. Finally, the Seaborn library, which works directly with tidy data, will be used to create effortless and elegant visualizations.
Day 5: Applied Machine Learning
After tidying, exploring, and visualizing data, machine learning models can be applied to gain deeper insights into the data. Workflows for preparing, modeling, validating and predicting data with Python's powerful machine learning library Scikit-Learn will be built. The very latest additions to Scikit-Learn have been incorporated into this material. See this blog post from Ted for more info.
Post-Course Assignment
Students will complete three end-to-end data analyses which will be personally reviewed by Ted. Students will learn how to create interactive dashboards and present their results with them.
Pedagogical Approach
Learning is accomplished by working through difficult assignments and receiving and reviewing modeled solutions. Using a 'flipped classroom', students will prepare and read each day's material before coming to class. In class, students will rotate from instructor guided lessons to student-focused exercises and projects. Ted is a very active participant and will sit alongside students as they complete the exercises.","2018-11-12T14:00:00Z","2018-11-16T22:00:00Z","America/New_York",40.712775,-74.005973

Join us at this year's Outsell DataMoney for innovative, practical and scalable solutions for contemporary data businesses where we take a deep dive into this year's theme, Client Value = Data Value.








Data is available at enormous scale, driven by billions of interconnected interactions between people, businesses, and devices/things. In the face of such diversity, how does an organization move up the information value curve to create client value, unique differentiation and command higher margin to grow the business?
The 2019 Outsell DataMoney conference reveals new opportunities in data monetization and commercialization. Leaders must make smart moves to navigate the shifting market conditions where today data/content is increasingly coalesced with technology and being infused into workflow to drive better decision making. To some extent, everyone is in the data business and equally in the technology business…. meaning unchartered waters for many companies today.
The Outsell DataMoney conference is especially designed for the individuals’ responsible for “getting it done” executing and monetizing data and product management. Our event is designed for CPOs and in some organizations the CDO/CTO or CSO depending on role responsibilities within your organization.
Outsell DataMoney builds upon the data monetization lifecycle through powerful keynotes, interactive workshops and tracks, and unparalleled networking opportunities with leaders who are connecting the dots from data to dollars. Some of the key themes we’ll cover:

The information value curve
Capitalizing on expanding and emerging data markets
Enabling technologies .... (AI, IoT, Data Management, Analytics and more )
Best practices to execute to win and ecosystem

Some say disrupt, or be disrupted; some say protect and grow, to some, it is the opportunity to capitalize on an adjacent market with a new data-driven product service…. At the end of the day, it is about accelerating your data and information business where client value is the ultimate measure of data value.

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

What this program is about:
Our program serves as the foundation for many well-known concepts of data science. We teach practical techniques and algorithms for extracting and studying useful knowledge from data. This course is not a theory class as we believe there are many ways to learn statistics and analytics concepts on your own. We are providing students with a set of practical tools for data science and knowledge on how to apply Python to solve linear algebra, statistics, and probability problems. This course is designed to fill the gap between theoretical academic research and the needs of the industry. We will start with a crash course on the basics of the Python programming language and then learn how to use Python to turn raw data into insight and knowledge. 
What to expect from this program:
Fundamental introduction to Data Science using Python programming language, practical application of different statistical, analytical and linear algebra models to a variety of data science projects, and feeling comfortable enough to apply acquired knowledge on your own seeking a junior data scientist position.

Discover best practices for data analysis and start on the path to becoming a data scientist
Get comfortable using Python to build statistical and analytical models
Learn and practice essential tools for data analytics: NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
Learn to find solutions to problems by analyzing data using appropriate tools
Master your analytical skills by working on real life projects
Explore graphical techniques to see what your data looks like
Implement the core Data Science techniques of Linear Algebra, Probability, Gradient Descent, and Linear Regression
Build your own analytical tools with Python from scratch
Become familiar with industry standards and learn the best practices for writing code
By the end of this course, you will have a Data Analytics Project to present to potential employers 

 
Who is this program for:
Novice and people with no previous programming experience, seeking a comprehensive course to enter the field of data and analytics and become data scientists.
How this program is organized:
Lecture on new topics takes about 90 minutes and starts at 11.00am. After lecture, students start working on new exercises with instructor guidance. Around 2.00pm students present and discuss their work with instructors, learn alternative solutions, and best practices from instructors and invited data scientist professionals.
Why Python:
Many other programming solutions can be used for Data Science, however we chose high-level programming language Python because it is easy to learn if you are new to programming and it is in high demand.

DATA JOURNALISM & DATA VISUALIZATION
**THIS IS A TWO-PART WORKSHOP. If you sign up, attendance for both days is mandatory.
About this workshop:
SATURDAY, October 20, 1pm to 5pm - PART 1: DATA CRUNCHING
As numerical data becomes a more important part of the investigative process, we as journalists need a thorough understanding of where to get it and what it means. Whether you're canvassing a data set for story ideas or smoking guns, Part I will develop your ability to clean data and process it enough to give up its secrets. This course is taught in Excel and will begin at a basic introductory level - no experience required.
SUNDAY, October 21, 1pm to 5pm - PART 2: DATA VISUALIZATION
The human brain isn't set up to conceptualize numbers. But it is finely tuned to process visual images on a tiny scale. Part II concentrates on the theory, philosophy, and practice of displaying statistical information in visual form, both for the purpose of discovering hidden trends and anomalies, and to persuade an audience of your findings. Class is taught using a variety of web tools and API's. Students who plan to attend should already be somewhat comfortable managing and organizing data sets. Excel knowledge is a plus, but is not required.
About the instructor:
Zoe Fraade-Blanar is an Interaction Designer and Data Artist. Her work has been used by outlets such as eBay, FINRA, The New York Times, The Hubble Space Telescope, The US Dept of Labor, The US Postal Service, and IBM.

Join Cyrus Farivar and Meredith Broussard for an engaging evening covering the cutting edges of technology in America.You are being watched. Whether through your phone or your car or your credit card, caught on a CCTV camera or tracked through your online viewing history, government agencies know where you are, and are quietly collecting your most intimate, mundane, and personal information. Is this even legal? HABEAS DATA shows how the explosive growth of surveillance technology has outpaced our understanding of the ethics, mores, and laws of privacy.Cyrus [suh-ROOS] Farivar is a Senior Tech Policy Reporter at Ars Technica, and is also an author and radio producer. He is based in Oakland, California.In ARTIFICIAL UNINTELLIGENCE, Meredith Broussard argues that our collective enthusiasm for applying computer technology to every aspect of life has resulted in a tremendous amount of poorly designed systems. We are so eager to do everything digitally—hiring, driving, paying bills, even choosing romantic partners—that we have stopped demanding that our technology actually work. Broussard, a software developer and journalist, reminds us that there are fundamental limits to what we can (and should) do with technology. With this book, she offers a guide to understanding the inner workings and outer limits of technology—and issues a warning that we should never assume that computers always get things right.Data journalist Meredith Broussard is an assistant professor at the Arthur L.

Designers, dive into data. 

Bring your data to life using innovative visualization techniques in this one-day workshop unlike any other, and learn from world leaders that come from two sides of data visualization: data science and design. Explore styles, techniques, and best practices to create meaningful and beautiful visualizations.
As the amount and speed of data grows at ever-increasing rates, being able to visualize and communicate data and data analysis has become more and more important. Organizations that are tasked with producing, releasing, and analyzing large amounts of data can more effectively do so by understanding how to visualize their data. In this full-day workshop, you will learn the important underpinnings of the science and design process behind data visualization and how to effectively communicate your work.
 This workshop will provide you with the core skills needed to conceptualize, plan, and develop data visualization products. Taught by world-renowned leaders in the field—Stefanie Posavec and Jonathan Schwabish—this full-day workshop will inspire you to push beyond your own limits so you can create great, effective visualizations. Step away from your keyboard and enjoy some fresh space for your hands and mind: the entire workshop will be off-screen, using nothing more than basic drawing materials and office supplies.
Working in groups, the instructors will guide you through the analysis of a dataset to the design and implementation of your own custom visualization method. You will expand your graphic knowledge, learn best practices, and discover different and innovative ways to communicate your data and analysis. Posavec and Schwabish will offer insights into the design principles that are integral to creating a successful visualization, regardless of function, medium, or context.
No coding skills, design skills, or data skills needed: the only requirement is an interest in data visualization!

About the Course
Data science is a ""concept to unify statistics, data analysis and their related methods"" to ""understand and analyze actual phenomena"" with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the broad areas of mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science from the subdomains of machine learning, classification, cluster analysis, data mining, databases, and visualization. The Data Science Certification Training enables you to gain knowledge of the entire Life Cycle of Data Science, analyzing and visualizing different data sets, different Machine Learning Algorithms like K-Means Clustering, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes. 
Who needs to attend?
The course is designed for all those who want to learn about the life cycle of Data Science, which would include acquisition of data from various sources, data wrangling and data visualization. Applying Machine Learning techniques in R language, and wish to apply these techniques on different types of Data. 
The following professionals can go for this course:
1. Developers aspiring to be a 'Data Scientist'
2. Analytics Managers who are leading a team of analysts 
3. Business Analysts who want to understand Machine Learning (ML) Techniques
4. Information Architects who want to gain expertise in Predictive Analytics
5. 'R' professionals who want to captivate and analyze Big Data
7. Analysts wanting to understand Data Science methodologies

What is this course about?
The incorporation of technology in our everyday lives has been made possible by the availability of data in enormous amounts. Data is drawn from different sectors and platforms including cell phones, social media, e-commerce sites, various surveys, internet searches, etc. 
However, the interpretation of vast amounts of unstructured data for effective decision making may prove too complex and time consuming for companies, hence, the emergence of Data Science.
Data science incorporates tools from multi disciplines to gather a data set, process and derive insights from the data set, extract meaningful data from the set, and interpret it for decision-making purposes. The disciplinary areas that make up the data science field include mining, statistics, machine learning, analytics, and some programming. Data mining applies algorithms in the complex data set to reveal patterns which are then used to extract useable and relevant data from the set. Statistical measures like predictive analytics utilize this extracted data to gauge events that are likely to happen in the future based on what the data shows happened in the past. Machine learning is an artificial intelligence tool that processes mass quantities of data that a human would be unable to process in a lifetime. Machine learning perfects the decision model presented under predictive analytics by matching the likelihood of an event happening to what actually happened at the predicted time.

This hands-on workshop will help product managers and other product practitioners level up their product leadership skills. Expect to work through collaborative exercises with alongside other smart, creative product leaders who want to level up their skills at both identifying the right products and features to build and building the support to do so. 
Together we will explore ways of quantifying a product opportunity in terms that matter to decision makers, while also sharing proven techniques for winning allies and influencing stakeholders. Whether you just got started in a new job or initiative or have a gnawing sense that your existing product needs a change in investment or direction, this workshop will equip you with tools and techniques you can use to build agreement as you evaluate the opportunity and steer your product toward success.
What will participants learn?

A step by step process for evaluating an idea to determine if the company should invest, persevere, pivot, or sunset.
How can you find the strongest product growth opportunity?
What discovery techniques will help you answer the most important questions?
How much qualitative vs quantitative discovery should you do?
How can you check your own biases and keep an open mind?
Which users should the product target first?
What metrics should you look at to determine if you're on track?
How can you influence the product strategy behind your directive?
What questions can you ask to push your colleagues to take off their rose colored glasses and get real?
How can you communicate your discovery findings to change minds without bruising egos?

Why are you teaching this workshop?
A Group Product Owner at Shutterstock, I successfully made the case to shutdown Skillfeed, an internally launched startup in the online education space. Next I led the launch of Shutterstock Editor from prototype to successful public beta in 3 months, generating praise from the target users who loved that it saved them time. I followed it up with a validated roadmap to support an increasing amount of valuable customer outcomes for a wider audience and a resource plan to scale the team 3x so that we could deliver on the original vision as fast as possible. By the end of Shutterstock Editor’s first year, the team had earned a reputation for continually delivering valuable improvements and product usage had grown 10X from its first month. 
Since then, I have helped several businesses, from startups like Plectica and GoCoach to enterprises like Babies R Us and Weight Watchers, determine when to invest, persevere, pivot, or kill everything from feature ideas to business units. I believe that the best product leaders are not only good at building new products, but also at recognizing when resources would be better spent elsewhere. I love sharing these learnings with product leaders who practice these entrepreneurship skills, whether in startups, scaling companies, or enterprises.
How is the workshop structured?
The majority of this one day workshop is made of group exercises around a case study, interspersed with product principles, examples, and additional case studies. You'll get to work closely with your peers from other companies.
What have past participants said about the workshop?
This is the kind of workshop I’d do on my own, even if my company doesn’t sponsor me. I felt the workshop was structured well, dividing us into groups, having us work silently and then collaboratively. We were constantly building on top of the previous work. I found it very useful! I think it would also be beneficial for strategists and product marketing managers. - Moises Eskinazi, Columbia Business School MBA Candidate and DigitalOcean Product Manager
I really enjoyed meeting the other workshop attendees and getting an extended view into Holly's product opportunity assessment process. I especially liked how Holly broke the guidelines down into digestible chunks for the break out sessions and built them back up together in the discussion. I also liked the format of a case study with her work at Shutterstock as examples. Felt free but not scary! - Grace Tuttle, Design Researcher & Strategist
I really enjoyed the workshop - the topic was one I feel like I am faced with more and more these days. I liked the way Holly did the product opportunity assessment, so I walked my team through some of the exercises to apply to a project we're working on now. It helped us to focus our experimentation. - Joe Lalley, Head of Product Management and User Experience Design at PwC, User Experience Design Instructor at General Assembly
Who should attend this workshop?
The workshop is ideal for startup founders, general managers, product leaders, marketing leaders, product managers, product designers, product marketers, user experience designers, user researchers, engineering leaders, data analysts, operations managers, and other product practitioners looking to level up their skills at product strategy and design or driving internal change.","2018-11-26T17:00:00Z","2018-11-27T01:00:00Z","America/Los_Angeles",40.712775,-74.005973

Speed Bumps Ahead
Each autonomous vehicle will be generating approximately 4,000 GB – or 4 terabytes – of data a day. Intel has suggested that just one million autonomous cars could generate the same data as three billion people. While the market for vehicle data monetization was $2 billion in 2017, it's expected to be $33 billion by 2025.
Here's the billion dollar question: Who will own and profit from the data that driverless cars collect and how will consumer data and privacy be protected?
By 2020 Business Insider Intelligence estimates there will be 10 million vehicles with self-driving functionality. But we face quite a few speed bumps ahead as tech companies, consumer privacy advocates, and legislators grapple with issues around driverless car data ownership and monitization (which experts are calling a future goldmine).
JOIN US for this special think tank discussion with expert guest speaker, Henry L. Greenidge, Esq. (Policy Advisor, East Coast Government & Communications Relations at Cruise Automation, a subsidiary of General Motors) who will speak on the opportunities and obstacles we face as the world transitions to driverless cars. What is the hype versus the reality? Also joining us will be an engineer from Knightscope (they design, build and deploy Autonomous Data Machines (ADMs) (robots) to monitor crimes in malls, corporate campuses, parking lots, airports and neighborhoods).
This event, which is part of our new Mission AI program, will be held at the Knightscope NY Showroom. Attendees will receive a tour of the showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their autonomous security robots. Also joining us from Knightscope to discuss how their autonomous robots gather and process data are Zoe Demertzis, Software Engineer, and Jason Hatfield, Director, Client Development. .



Discussion Highlights
Industry experts agree that data sharing is crucial to driverless car development. What considerations should be taken into account around how to share data responsibly with private companies, with municipalities, and with researchers (while protecting consumer data and privacy)?
The fact is driverless car manufacturers will collect and control a vast amount of data on our driving habits, what we do in cars, and where we go (not to mention data on public surroundings, accidents, etc.). And consumers appear to be ready to give up their data. In a HERE Technologies new study that questioned 8,000 people across Australia, Brazil, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK and the US, the results indicated that 76% of people are left stressed and feeling vulnerable about sharing their location data, but 72% are willing to share their data for a driverless car.
Are consumers really aware of what they will be giving up in the long run? How can consumers benefit from car data ownership?
In addition to reviewing recent, compelling research, some of the topics we'll explore include:

How are autonomous vehicles gathering information about our driving habits and behaviors and the broader environment around them?
The changing expectations of privacy: Do consumers’ expectations of privacy diminish in a post-ownership, shared vehicle model?
How should we think about privacy considerations for the general public whose movements may be tracked with the externally-facing videos or mapping that may be common with AVs?
How will advertisers and brands gain access to driverless car data and how will they use it to push more targeted ads and brand experiences to consumers (with the permission of the consumer)?
How are smart cities using data to pave the way for driverless cities and what data will they share with (and request from) car manufacturers and car owners?
What are the legal and ethical problems around driverless car data ownership and privacy?
What are the federal government and local municipalities doing now to draft legislation that will regulate data mining and protect consumers?
When a crime is committed or a car accident happens, what car data will police request and what are the manufacturers' and consumers' rights?
What data will insurance companies require from driverless car owners and how will they use it? Will we see new insurance models as a result of companies having access to more precise, intimate driver data?
How can we protect companies and consumers from hackers who will attempt to steal and sell their car data?

After the presentation, and interactive discussion and Q&A, we'll receive a tour of the Knightscope showroom and a live, hands-on demo of their crime-fighting, autonomous security robots (you'll get to see, up close, autonomous machines collect data and what is done with that data).
