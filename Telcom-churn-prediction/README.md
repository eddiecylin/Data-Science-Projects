# Project description: 
This project uses customer data from a telecommunication company and intends to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn. Using different demographic and behavioral features about the customers in this dataset, the goals of is project are: (1) build and optimize a classification model that can predict customer churn and (2) identify important features in the dataset for marketing, operation, and customer relationship team to design their action plans to maximize customer retention.

The following will be a presentation of the key findings in this project 

## Data source & feature overview:
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle. Excluding customer ID, there are 19 features which will be used as predictors and 1 target variable (customer churn). Here is the list for feature definitions.
